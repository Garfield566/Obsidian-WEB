**coin**, a piece of metal or, rarely, some other material (such as leather or porcelain) certified by a [mark](https://www.britannica.com/money/mark-German-currency) or marks upon it as being of a specific intrinsic or exchange value.

The use of cast-metal pieces as a medium of exchange is very ancient and probably developed out of the use in commerce of ordinary [ingots](https://www.britannica.com/technology/ingot) of [bronze](https://www.britannica.com/technology/bronze-alloy) and other metals that possessed an [intrinsic value](https://www.britannica.com/money/intrinsic-value). Until the development of [bills of exchange](https://www.britannica.com/money/bill-of-exchange) in medieval Europe and paper [currency](https://www.britannica.com/money/currency) in medieval China, metal coins were the only such medium. Despite their diminished use in most commercial transactions, coins are still indispensable to modern economies; in fact, their importance is growing as the result of the widespread use of coin-operated machines. For a discussion of paper currencies, *see* [money](https://www.britannica.com/money/money).

## Coins as historical data

Being made in most ages of precious [metal](https://www.britannica.com/science/metal-chemistry), or alternatively possessing a substantial token value, coins have always been prized, often hoarded, and, therefore, frequently buried for safety. The contents of such savings banks have been dug up in all ages, so that the coins of past civilizations continue to be found in vast numbers. Studied alongside literary or archaeological evidence, they yield a wide range of information that is especially valuable for chronology and [economic history](https://www.britannica.com/money/economic-history). Coins may reflect the wealth and power of cities and states, and study of their distribution may help to define the physical extent of territorial dominion or to illustrate major commercial connections. Thus, the popularity in ancient times of Athenian coins in the Levant and of Corinthian silver in [Magna Graecia](https://www.britannica.com/place/Magna-Graecia) (southern Italy) testifies to established trade links. Finds of early Roman imperial gold in India corroborate the reference of the Roman historian [Pliny the Elder](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Pliny-the-Elder) to the drain on Roman gold to pay for Indian and other Eastern luxuries. Likewise, huge finds of Arab silver coins in Scandinavia show the extent of trade, in particular the demand for furs by the ʿAbbāsid caliphs and the Sāmānid rulers of Iran. One result of such widespread commercial contacts is that certain currencies acquired special international preeminence. In ancient times, those of Athens, Corinth, and [Philip II](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Philip-II-king-of-Macedonia) of Macedon were widely popular. The uniform [coinage](https://www.britannica.com/money/coinage) of Philip’s son [Alexander the Great](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Alexander-the-Great) was struck at mints widely scattered throughout his vast empire and was universally accepted. In medieval times, the gold dinars (a term derived from the Roman denarius) of the early caliphs and the gold ducats of Florence and Venice played a similar role—as did the silver dollars of Mexico, the [Maria Theresa](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Maria-Theresa) of Austria, and the gold sovereigns of Great Britain in modern times. Moreover, the study of depreciation and debasement of coinage may illuminate past national financial distress. For example, the heavily alloyed 3rd-century- ad Roman antoniniani (coins introduced by the Roman emperor Caracalla, originally having a value of two denarii) tell their tale as clearly as the depreciating paper currency of Germany in and after 1919.

No less valuable than the economic evidence yielded by a comparative study of coins is their purely [documentary](https://www.britannica.com/topic/documentation) importance. Together with [medals](https://www.britannica.com/topic/medal), they present an unrivaled series of historical portraits from the 4th century bc to the present day, many of them otherwise unknown, like the Greco-Bactrian kings or certain usurpers during the Roman Empire. Greek coinage is a particularly notable contribution to the history of art, displaying not only the beauty and strength of many artistic traditions but also (like Roman coinage) the miniature likenesses of numerous large-scale sculptural and architectural works now lost. The imperial coinage of Rome, apart from its portraiture, is important above all for the remarkable detail of its chronological and political content; and from both [Greek](https://www.britannica.com/place/ancient-Greece) and Roman coins much can be learned of [mythology](https://www.britannica.com/topic/myth) and religion. The Christian influences active in medieval Europe can be similarly measured from medieval currencies.

The principal metals of which ancient coins were made were [electrum](https://www.britannica.com/science/electrum), [gold](https://www.britannica.com/science/gold-chemical-element), [silver](https://www.britannica.com/science/silver), [copper](https://www.britannica.com/science/copper), [brass](https://www.britannica.com/technology/brass-alloy), and [bronze](https://www.britannica.com/technology/bronze-alloy) —all of them more or less resistant to decay. Their use at first was generally dictated by availability. The earliest coins of [Asia Minor](https://www.britannica.com/place/Anatolia) were of electrum, a natural occurring [alloy](https://www.britannica.com/technology/alloy) washed from Lydian rivers (electrum was later produced artificially). Gold became the major currency metal of southwestern Asia as a whole, being derived from Scythian, Pontic, and Bactrian sources. The city-states of the Greek mainland preferred the silver that adjacent mines supplied, and the mines of [Italy](https://www.britannica.com/topic/history-of-Italy) led to the choice of bronze for the earliest coinage of Rome. With the development of internal economies and external trade, gold, silver, and copper or bronze quickly came to be used side by side; [Philip II](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Philip-II-king-of-Macedonia) of Macedon popularized gold in Greece, but it became paramount only in the Byzantine and Arab empires and in the great commercial currencies of the Italian republics of the 13th century onward. Silver, however, was nearly always powerful in Roman currency and was the major coinage metal of Europe from the 8th to the 13th century. Bronze or copper was first used for small change in Greece from the late 5th century bc and in the Roman and Byzantine systems as well; the vast currency of China consisted of base metals down to modern times.

The foregoing metals furnished most currencies until the early 20th century, when the appreciation in value of gold and silver and the need to economize led to the general production of [paper](https://www.britannica.com/technology/paper) currencies for the higher units of value. Token units of lower value expressed in terms of [nickel](https://www.britannica.com/science/nickel-chemical-element) (used, exceptionally, in [Bactria](https://www.britannica.com/place/Bactria) in the 2nd century bc), [cupronickel](https://www.britannica.com/technology/cupronickel), bronze, and, in times of postwar stress, [aluminum](https://www.britannica.com/science/aluminum) and [aluminum bronze](https://www.britannica.com/technology/aluminum-bronze) supplemented precious metals in some countries. [Lead](https://www.britannica.com/science/lead-chemical-element), which may easily decay, has seldom been used for coinage, except by the Andhras (inhabitants of the Deccan in ancient India), in pre-Roman Gaul, and in the more recent coinages of the Malay states. [Iron](https://www.britannica.com/science/iron-chemical-element), very occasionally used in antiquity—e.g., in Sparta—reappeared in German coins of [World War I](https://www.britannica.com/event/World-War-I). [Zinc](https://www.britannica.com/science/zinc) was employed by Rome as a constituent of fine brass coins and as an element in the alloy of a few Chinese coins from the 15th to the 17th century. Base [metals](https://www.britannica.com/science/tin) furnished the material for some Celtic coins in Gaul and Britain in the last century bc. In crises, currencies have been produced from leather, cloth, card, paper, and other materials.

## Origins of coins

In both the East and the West, [coinage](https://www.britannica.com/money/coinage) proper was preceded by more primitive currencies, nonmonetary or semi-monetary, which survived into the historic age of true coins, and may have derived originally from the [barter](https://www.britannica.com/money/barter-trade) of cattle, implements, and the like. The earliest [currency](https://www.britannica.com/money/currency) of China of the 8th century bc consisted of miniature hoes and billhooks (pruning implements), with inscriptions indicating the authority. The small bronze [celts](https://www.britannica.com/technology/celt-tool) (prehistoric tools resembling chisels) and bronze rings frequently found in hoards in western Europe probably played a monetary role. Even in modern times such mediums of exchange as fishhook currency have been known.

Metal has always achieved wide popularity as an exchange medium, being durable, divisible, and portable; and the origins of true coinage lie there. [Ancient Egypt](https://www.britannica.com/place/ancient-Egypt), which was using [gold](https://www.britannica.com/science/gold-chemical-element) bars of set weight from the 4th millennium bc, eventually developed a currency of gold rings (but it did not adopt the use of coinage in [foreign trade](https://www.britannica.com/money/international-trade) until the late 4th century ad). In the [Middle East](https://www.britannica.com/place/ancient-Middle-East), gold rings long served the dual purposes of adornment and currency, supplemented by gold and [silver](https://www.britannica.com/science/silver) bars from which segments could be cut. The choice of metal was, as usual, determined by availability. Around the [Aegean Sea](https://www.britannica.com/place/Aegean-Sea), heavy [copper](https://www.britannica.com/science/copper) ingots were used as currency several centuries before the invention of true coinage. These ingots, known as [talents](https://www.britannica.com/science/talent-unit-of-weight), were originally a unit of weight of roughly 55 to 60 pounds (more than 25 kg); talents were later used as a measure of value. The discovery of an iron bar with a handful (*[drachma](https://www.britannica.com/money/drachma)*) of fractional iron spits (*obeloi*) dedicated in the Heraeum (a temple of the goddess Hera) at [Argos](https://www.britannica.com/place/Argos), perhaps as part of King [Pheidon](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Pheidon) of Argos’ reforms of [weights and measures](https://www.britannica.com/topic/weights-and-measures) in the 7th century bc, shows such currency continuing until historical times. Similar bundles of spits have been found elsewhere and are evidence of the desire to subdivide a cumbersome unit into smaller fractions for normal use. At the other end of the scale, there was, ultimately, the desire to express the value of a talent of copper or iron in terms of gold or silver; and Homer, who speaks of metal basins, tripods, and axes as gifts and prizes in a way that shows them as a recognized standard of wealth, also speaks of the talent of gold (i.e., the value of a heavy base-metal talent expressed in a little pellet of gold). In [Italy](https://www.britannica.com/topic/history-of-Italy) rough lumps of bronze (*aes rude*) formed a currency from early times, being succeeded by bars of regular weight; and Julius Caesar’s record of the ancient British use of iron bars as currency (following his raids on Britain in 55 and 54 bc) is still borne out by not infrequent finds.

Such “heavy” currencies, mainly characteristic of European lands, show the employment of metals from which implements would normally be made. The impact upon this system of the gold of the East, and later of the silver of Greece, produced the need to value such metals in gold and silver, and this in turn resulted in the need to control and guarantee the quantity of gold and silver so used to avoid constant weighing. Once gold (and then silver) gained acceptance as conveniently small expressions of relatively high value, with a visible [mark](https://www.britannica.com/money/mark-German-currency) of guarantee, the stage of true coinage, as it first appeared in [Asia Minor](https://www.britannica.com/place/Anatolia) and India, had been reached. Not all lands, however, adopted true coinage: the easternmost fringes of the Greek world lacked it, and Carthage and Etruria were without coinage until the 5th century ad.

## Ancient Greek coins

## Early developments, c. 650–490 bc

True coinage began soon after 650 bc. The 6th-century Greek poet Xenophanes, quoted by the historian [Herodotus](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Herodotus-Greek-historian), ascribed its invention to the [Lydians](https://www.britannica.com/place/Lydia-ancient-region-Anatolia), “the first to strike and use coins of gold and silver.” King [Croesus](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Croesus) of [Lydia](https://www.britannica.com/place/Lydia-ancient-region-Anatolia) (reigned *c.* 560–546 bc) produced a bimetallic system of pure gold and pure silver coins, but the foundation deposit of the Artemisium (temple to Artemis) at Ephesus shows that [electrum](https://www.britannica.com/science/electrum) coins were in production before Croesus, possibly under King Gyges. Croesus’ earliest coins were of electrum, which the Greeks called “white gold.” They were stamped on one side with the facing heads of a lion and a bull; this type was later transferred to his bimetallic series of pure gold and pure silver. (Some recent scholarship, however, suggests that this latter series was struck, in fact, under Croesus’ Persian successors.)

The early electrum coinage consisted of small, thick, bean-shaped pieces, with a device stamped in relief on one side, the other being roughly impressed. Their [intrinsic value](https://www.britannica.com/money/intrinsic-value) fluctuated according to their gold and silver content; but the weight of the unit was fairly steady at about seven to eight grams, and the types stamped on them were the guarantee of authority.

Croesus’ relations with Greece were close, and his bimetallic system may have owed something to the fact that Greece had itself now produced its first silver coins. The oldest are of [Aegina](https://www.britannica.com/place/Aegina-island-Greece), with, obverse, a turtle—associated with Aphrodite—and, reverse, an incuse square. Tradition—e.g., in [Julius Pollux](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Julius-Pollux), the 2nd-century- ad Greek scholar, and elsewhere—regarded these as struck by [Pheidon](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Pheidon) of Argos in virtue of his supremacy over Aegina; but the coins are too late to claim association with him in Aegina. They began no earlier than the late 7th century, when Aeginetan maritime ascendancy was growing, incidentally spreading the Aeginetan weight standard for coinage, based on a [drachma](https://www.britannica.com/money/drachma) of about six grams, over much of the Peloponnese and also the Aegean, where similar currency was produced in the islands. Ambition and pride stimulated two neighbouring powers to strike their own coins. [Corinth](https://www.britannica.com/place/Corinth-Greece) with its pegasi (from their constant obverse type of a [pegasus](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Pegasus-Greek-mythology)) was coining silver from about 575 with a light drachma of about three grams, and it is reasonably certain that in Athens, in the first half of the 6th century, Attic coins, based on a drachma of about 4.25 grams derived from Euboea and with a variety of obverse types, including an owl (the reverses, like those of the Corinthian pegasi, were impressed with a die design), were supplanting the earlier coinage of Aegina. These early silver coins, while much less valuable intrinsically than the electrum and gold coins of Asia Minor, nevertheless possessed considerable purchasing power: the Aeginetan and Attic-Euboic didrachms and the Corinthian tridrachm were high denominations suitable for major commerce and not for everyday life. For intercity transactions these staters (i.e., standard units) were conveniently linked by the mina weight (1 / 60 of a talent) of 425 grams, made up by 150 Corinthian, 100 Attic, and 70 Aeginetan drachmas. Fractional pieces developed only slowly.

Between 550 and 500 commerce and civic pride had spread coinage to many parts of the Greek world. From the Persian Empire, with its vast gold and silver coinage, successor to that of Croesus, to [Magna Graecia](https://www.britannica.com/place/Magna-Graecia) and Sicily, and from the Dorian colony of Cyrene to the Greek or semi-Greek cities of Thrace, there was a network of varied and competitive currencies, generally of fine quality and steady weight. Improved minting techniques began to affect their appearance. A second type, in relief, was substituted gradually for the roughly impressed reverse punch. The important effect of this on the development of coin types is well seen in the reorganized coinage of [Athens](https://www.britannica.com/place/Athens) from about 525, in which the obverse bears the [Athena](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Athena-Greek-mythology) head and the reverse the owl of Athens—religious patron and civic device; the monarch’s head on an English penny goes back, through Alexander’s deified head, to the head of Athena, and the symbol of Britannia derives ultimately from such state badges as the owl. In certain cities of Italy and [Sicily](https://www.britannica.com/place/Sicily), however, including Tarentum and Metapontum, a different technique was popular, the obverse type in relief being repeated intaglio on the reverse, very probably with the object of concealing the older types of coins imported for restriking. For a long time the early coins of Greece carried no inscriptions or, at most, with very rare exceptions, a letter or two referring to the issuing city or state authority.

Greek coin types, early and even later, were simple in conception and often taken from the [animal](https://www.britannica.com/animal/animal) world. They include many kinds of animals (with the bull, symbol of a river, very common); birds (such as the owl of Athens, the eagle of [Zeus](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Zeus) at Olympia, the dove at Sicyon); insects (like the bee of Ephesus); fabulous creatures (like the [griffin](https://www.britannica.com/topic/griffin-mythological-creature) at Abdera); and vegetable objects. Not uncommonly such types were chosen as punning allusions to a city’s name—the lion at Leontini; the goat at Aegae; the quince at Melos; the sickle-shaped harbour at Zancle; the *selinon* leaf at Selinus; the cock, harbinger of *hemera,* the day, at Himera. In others a city’s staple product was proclaimed, like silphium at Cyrene, a silver-miner’s pick at Damastium, a bunch of grapes at Naxos, a wine jar at Chios. Cult associations frequently dictated the choice of type. Tarentum showed its mythical founder, the dolphin-rider Taras; Knossos, the [Minotaur](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Minotaur) (half man, half bull) or Labyrinth; Croton, the [tripod](https://www.britannica.com/topic/tripod-furniture) of [Apollo](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Apollo-Greek-mythology); Poseidonia, a statue of [Poseidon](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Poseidon), god of the sea. Human or anthropomorphic figures, however, were comparatively rare on early Greek coins, though the famous gold darics, a name derived from [Darius I](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Darius-I), and silver [shekels](https://www.britannica.com/money/sheqel) of Persia showed the great king in an attitude of attack.

Much more popular was the representation of idealized heads of deities, which, once established for the two Athenas, Parthenos and Chalinitis, at Athens and Corinth, quickly became the vogue elsewhere, encouraged by the development of double-relief coinage (i.e., coinage with obverse and reverse in relief), which allowed the head of a civic deity to be paired on the other side by the city’s symbol. The Greek tyrants, as a rule, chose to respect the theory of coinage as the corporate expression of state economy and thus regarded coinage as too important a matter for private production. The traditions that, rightly or wrongly, associated all the great lawgivers—Pheidon, Solon, and Lycurgus—with the institution of coinage as well as with reform of weights emphasize its position as a fundamentally corporate right.

In [Sicily](https://www.britannica.com/place/Sicily) the defeat of Carthage in 480 bc may have been commemorated by the famous [decadrachms](https://www.britannica.com/topic/decadrachm) (*Demareteia*) associated with Queen Demarete, wife of King Gelon. These superb and now very rare examples of early classical genius showed on the obverse the head of [Arethusa](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Arethusa-Greek-mythology) (the fountain nymph of Syracusan Ortygia), wreathed (possibly for victory), and on the reverse a chariot above a fleeing lion.

## From the Persian Wars to Alexander the Great, 490–336 bc

For a century and a half the previous pattern of Greek [coinage](https://www.britannica.com/money/coinage) spread widely all over the Greek world, its quantity stimulated by a growing sense of nationalism, its intrinsic quality kept high by commercial competition, and its technique raised to new and often superb levels in an age of self-confidence. In the last half of the period the designing and [engraving](https://www.britannica.com/art/engraving) of coin [dies](https://www.britannica.com/technology/die) (punches) reached a standard rarely to be surpassed. The head of a patron deity was now generally established as the obverse type and was often shown in very high relief, sometimes indeed facing, as a tour de force. Engravers, especially in Sicily and Italy, began to sign their dies, thus preserving the names of masters such as the Syracusans Euainetos, [Cimon](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Cimon-of-Cleonae), and Eukleidas, otherwise unknown. Reverse types, now more complex, increasingly showed groups or genre scenes—e.g., the splendid frontally squatting Silenus (foster father of the wine god Dionysus) on the coinage for the refounding of Sicilian Naxos in 461, [Dionysus](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Dionysus) seated backward on a donkey at Mende, or the many mythological compositions on Cretan coins—often diminishing the previous importance of the city badge. Inscriptions, though still often contracted, were in general use. The principal coinage metal was [silver](https://www.britannica.com/science/silver), of which the Attic weight standard gradually conquered the Aeginetan. Electrum was continued in the east—at Cyzicus, Lampsacus, Mytilene, and Phocaea—traveling thence mainly to the Black Sea; in the west it was coined at Carthage. In both areas it was produced as an artificial [alloy](https://www.britannica.com/technology/alloy). Gold was continued in the darics of the Persian kings and in the fine later series of Lampsacene staters; it was also struck at Panticapaeum on the [Black Sea](https://www.britannica.com/place/Black-Sea) and on occasion at Syracuse, Tarentum, and Cyrene. Toward the end of the period, Philip II of Macedon instituted what was to be a world-famous [gold](https://www.britannica.com/science/gold-chemical-element) coinage, undercutting and ousting that of Persia. Bronze made its appearance late in the 5th century, replacing the minute silver obol and other fractional silver coins that had hitherto been used as small change.

The currencies of the period included a few that were of world importance. The silver of Corinth and its Adriatic colonies was very numerous and was abundantly accepted, outside the Corinthian territories, by Italy and Sicily. The [electrum](https://www.britannica.com/science/electrum) of Cyzicus bore types that deliberately recommended it to many markets. Persian gold and silver coins enjoyed immense popularity in the 5th century. Metapontum, Tarentum, Thurium, Velia, and Syracuse were among the more prolific silver mints of the west. But the most famous commercial [currency](https://www.britannica.com/money/currency) of all was that of Athens, the silver tetradrachms of which were struck in large numbers, fine quality, and obstinately unchanged appearance. These coins traveled widely in trade and were imitated as far afield as Egypt, Arabia, and Persia.

## Predominance of Athens

Economic expansion and naval hegemony gave Athens near-imperial control over its allies in the 5th century. It may have been as early as 449 that Athenian edicts forbade the striking of silver coins by the allies or the use of currency, weights, and measures other than the Athenian and provided that previously minted local currencies should be handed in for exchange against that of Athens. The subjection of [Aegina](https://www.britannica.com/place/Aegina-island-Greece) to Athens from 456 and the cessation of its famous and long-competitive “turtles” facilitated the monetary dominance of the “owls,” which was carried further, stage by stage, as Athenian “allies” revolted, were reconquered, and lost their independence. But the embargo put by Athens on local silver coinage was not absolute and perhaps was not expected to be. Major allies such as Samos, Chios, and Lesbos continued their own currencies; Phocaea, Mytilene, and Cyzicus, though ceasing to coin in silver, continued with electrum. In other cities, small change in silver was issued. Beyond the effective range of Athenian power, cities in Pamphylia (e.g., Aspendus) and in Thrace (e.g., Abdera and Aenus) could continue silver coinage on a non-Attic standard, and the failure of Athenian control is seen in the sudden and often beautiful coinages of cities that threw aside its dominance, such as Olynthus from about 430, or in the changed weight standard of others (e.g., Acanthus). During the [Peloponnesian War](https://www.britannica.com/event/Peloponnesian-War), Sparta cut off the supply of silver from the Laurium mines, and by 407 Athens was melting the gold Nikai (victory statues) from the Parthenon to make emergency coins, followed the next year by bronze small change—an unpopular substitute for the tiny silver coins previously carried in the mouth. City after city now rebelled against Athens, and there was a sudden burst of independent coinage.

Athenian coinage revived, with unchanged types, after the Athenian admiral Conon’s successes against the Spartan fleet in 394. But wary former allies formed defensive leagues, as shown by current coinage, with a type of the Greek hero [Heracles](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Heracles) and the inscription ΣΥΝ (“the alliance”), by Cnidus, Ephesus, Samos, Byzantium, and other cities under Rhodian leadership. Rhodes spread its own coinage (with its head of the sun-god Helios and punning badge of a rose—Rhodon) widely in the eastern Mediterranean. Phocaea and Mytilene established a [monetary union](https://www.britannica.com/money/monetary-union) for their electrum. From 404 the Aeginetans were coining again, and on their former weight standard, though with a tortoise replacing the turtle. Corinthian coins continued to pour out. In the north a variety of important mints opened, and coins from mints in [Asia Minor](https://www.britannica.com/place/Anatolia), notably Cnidus and Ephesus, testify to the prosperity brought by autonomy.

## Artistic development

In contrast to the deliberate archaism of Athenian types, a wide flowering was seen elsewhere. Sometimes this was the result of hybridizing influence, as when Greek artists rendered Scythian motifs at Panticapaeum or Punic ones for Carthage and such of its Sicilian colonies as Segesta and Eryx. Sometimes an artistic tradition was regional, harsh, and arresting, as in [Crete](https://www.britannica.com/place/Crete) or, as in Massilia and Emporion in the far west, a weak reflection of finer styles. Generally, however, there was an internationally high standard in coin design. Elis, guardian of the temple of Olympian [Zeus](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Zeus) and famous for its quadrennial [Olympic Games](https://www.britannica.com/sports/Olympic-Games), no doubt attempted to impress visitors with its superb [coinage](https://www.britannica.com/money/coinage). On the coins issued from about 500 to 322, the thunderbolt and eagle of Zeus were shown with Victory in various attitudes; later the heads of Zeus and Hera were nobly represented. In northern Greece brilliant artistry characterized the coins of Amphipolis, Acanthus, and Chalcidian Olynthus. The coins of Clazomenae and Cnidus in eastern Greece were also notable for their designs.

It was in [Italy](https://www.britannica.com/topic/history-of-Italy) and [Sicily](https://www.britannica.com/place/Sicily) that the finest work appeared. In Italy, Tarentine [silver](https://www.britannica.com/science/silver) continued its type of Taras on a dolphin. In the middle of the 5th century the agonistic type showing a horseman appeared; the celebrated Tarentine cavalry was thus commemorated down to the middle of the 4th century. About 340 Tarentum issued very beautiful [gold](https://www.britannica.com/science/gold-chemical-element) coins with a head of [Persephone](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Persephone-Greek-goddess) and, on the reverse, the infant Taras appealing to Zeus enthroned. Heraclea, founded in the middle of the 5th century, issued fine staters with a helmeted Athena and Heracles seated or strangling or wrestling with a lion. Metapontum introduced a most striking head of its founder, [Leucippus](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Leucippus). Other mints of the time were at Neapolis, with its types of the siren Parthenope and her father, the man-headed bull Achelous; at Velia, with its head of a nymph and, on the reverse, the eastern type of a lion attacking a bull; at Thurium, with its unusually fine head of Athena and the powerful bull on the reverse; and at Terina, remarkable for its beautiful treatment of the Victory type.

In Sicily, and particularly in [Syracuse](https://www.britannica.com/place/Syracuse-Italy), the [engraver](https://www.britannica.com/art/engraving) ’s art reached perfection. The coins of Syracuse showed many varieties of the heads of Arethusa and Persephone, and the chariot of the reverse was found capable of varied treatment. After the middle of the 5th century, artists began to sign their work, and it is thus possible to prove that other towns engaged engravers from Syracuse. The Syracusan coinage was mainly silver. During the siege by the Athenians, beautiful little gold coins were struck with, reverse, Heracles strangling a lion. With the prosperity following the enemy’s defeat, Syracusan art reached its zenith. As the Demareteion commemorated the defeat of the Carthaginians, so the great series of decadrachms perpetuated the memory of the victory of 413 over the Athenians. The agonistic types and the word *athla* on some of them show that they were distributed at the games held to celebrate the victory; their types were widely copied, and their engravers, Cimon and Euainetos, gained a place among the world’s greatest artists.

Among other cities of Sicily there was a notable series from [Acragas](https://www.britannica.com/place/Agrigento) in the 5th century, with its beautiful double-eagle type, seen most magnificently on the rare and famous decadrachms. Camarina showed fine types of the river god Hipparis and the nymph Camarina on a swan. [Himera](https://www.britannica.com/place/Himera), before its destruction in 409, issued some very interesting types, such as the nymph Himera sacrificing while Silenus beside her bathes at the [thermal spring](https://www.britannica.com/science/hot-spring) for which Himera was noted; or [Pelops](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Pelops) (a grandson of Zeus) in his chariot, referring to a victory of a Himeran at the Olympic Games, which Pelops is said to have founded. Catana used the artist Heracleidas to design a splendid facing head of [Apollo](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Apollo-Greek-mythology). [Selinus](https://www.britannica.com/place/Selinus-ancient-city-Sicily) abandoned its parsley leaf and issued some remarkable types, notably that of Apollo and [Artemis](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Artemis-Greek-goddess) in their quadriga and, on the reverse, the local hero sacrificing at an altar, alluding to the cessation of the plague as a result of appeals to Apollo as healer.

## From Alexander the Great to the end of the Roman Republic, c. 336–31 bc

Alexander introduced a new era in coinage, struck in vast quantities at a variety of mints from [Macedonia](https://www.britannica.com/place/Macedonia-ancient-kingdom-Europe) to Babylon with uniform types and weights. After his death in 323 bc the [Diadochi](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Diadochoi) (“Successors”—a reference to the chief officers who partitioned his empire) were to reflect the importance of his coinage in their own differentiated issues— [Seleucus](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Seleucus-I-Nicator) in Syria, Philip Arrhidaeus in Macedonia, [Lysimachus](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Lysimachus) in Thrace, and Ptolemy in [Egypt](https://www.britannica.com/place/ancient-Egypt), where, except for tentative gold coined by Tachos and [Nectanebo II](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Nectanebo-II) between 361 and 343, no coinage had previously been struck. Alexander’s influence on the Greek fringe was no less marked. The Arsacid kings of Parthia instituted a Greek style of coinage, as did Bactrian kings, culminating in the splendid portrait decadrachms of Amyntas circa 150 bc, while, even farther to the southeast, Indo-Greek kings struck coins, inscribed in both Greek and Prākrit, to the end of the 2nd century. The flood of coins of Philip II and Alexander, penetrating Europe from the Balkans, resulted in progressive imitations by Celtic peoples westward along the Danube until these imitations themselves influenced coins in Gaul and Britain in the 1st century bc. In the Mediterranean west, by contrast, Greek coinage yielded to the steady advance of Roman power; the late issues of Spain and Mauretania were of hybrid Greco-Roman origin.

## The coin portrait

The coinage of Alexander established a new style: the coin portrait became an almost regular feature in Greek [currency](https://www.britannica.com/money/currency) that was predominantly regal. The portrait, however, was not at first that of a living monarch. Philip II and Alexander were content with their names on their coins, of which the obverses showed, for Philip, Apollo and Zeus and, for Alexander, Heracles and Athena. Alexander added the title basileus (king) only after his Persian conquest. After his death his deified portrait appeared on the coins of [Lysimachus](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Lysimachus) in Thrace and on the early coins of [Ptolemy I](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Ptolemy-I-Soter) in Egypt. It was not until 306 that a living king put his own portrait on his coins, when Ptolemy I appeared, still as god, with the aegis of Zeus. [Seleucus I](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Seleucus-I-Nicator) similarly put himself on his coins as Dionysus; in time the divine attribute was dropped, and the ruler appeared as a mortal wearing only the royal diadem. In Macedonia, Arrhidaeus, Cassander, and Antigonus still followed the types of Alexander; and the early coins of [Demetrius I Poliorcetes](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Demetrius-I-Poliorcetes) (336–283) were without a portrait. Soon, however, his own portrait appeared, still with the horns that deify him. His successor had only types of deities. Pyrrhus did not appear on any of his extensive coinages, but the last two kings of Macedonia, Perseus and Philip V, left very fine portraits. The kings of [Pontus](https://www.britannica.com/place/Pontus-ancient-district-Turkey), notably Mithradates VI, had a magnificent series of portraits. The kings of [Pergamum](https://www.britannica.com/place/Pergamum) used the same portrait throughout, that of the founder of the dynasty, Philetairus I, and the Ptolemies in Egypt throughout their long series used only the head and legend of Ptolemy I, except on certain special issues. Among the early Seleucids, Antiochus I was reluctant to drop the portrait of Seleucus I, but the portrait of the reigning monarch became the rule.

After the vast issues of gold by Philip II, Alexander (under whom its price in relation to silver cheapened to 1:10 from 1:13 or more), and Lysimachus, gold was but rarely struck. Silver was the general metal of coinage; the Attic standard, which Alexander had adopted for his tetradrachms, became the monetary standard of the Western world, and there was a great increase in the bronze coinage. Egypt, however, kept to its own standards and to gold.

As the greater part of the Greek world was now ruled by the Diadochi, their various coinages naturally formed the main currencies of commerce. Third-century Athenian coinages were scarce except in bronze. In 229, however, Macedonia lost its supremacy over Athens, and friendly relations were established between Athens and Rome. Shortly after 200 the abundant issue of tetradrachms of the “new style” began, which went on for slightly more than a century, replacing the “archaic” Athena with a copy of the head of the Parthenos of the Athenian sculptor [Phidias](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Phidias), and with an owl on the reverse perched on a Panathenaic amphora. Corinth went on striking its stater until 229, when, with its surrender to [Antigonus III Doson](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Antigonus-III-Doson), king of Macedonia from 227, the long series came to an end.

## Rise of Rome

After the Roman conquest of Greece it is clear from the resumed activity of the mints that the Greek cities were autonomous in one respect at least, for the [silver](https://www.britannica.com/science/silver) [coinage](https://www.britannica.com/money/coinage) required in Greek territory could be supplied only by Greek mints, the task being beyond the power of Rome at this time. The [Thessalians](https://www.britannica.com/place/Thessaly) issued silver coins of the type of Zeus and Athena and the legend *Thessalon;* a similar coinage was issued by the Boeotians. Maronea and [Thasos](https://www.britannica.com/place/Thasos) issued tetradrachms that became a great commercial [currency](https://www.britannica.com/money/currency) for trade across the Danube with the Scythians and Celts who imitated them. Macedonia itself issued tetradrachms bearing the names of Roman governors. In Asia, after the defeat of Antiochus III at Magnesia, there was an outburst of tetradrachms of Attic weight and local types at towns such as Lampsacus, Smyrna, and Magnesia. Other cities resumed the issue of Alexander tetradrachms, continuing to the middle of the 2nd century, when the Roman province of Asia was set up and cistophori replaced them. These, so called from the Dionysian chest (the sacred box or basket carried in the worship of Dionysus, usually shown containing snakes), which formed the principal type, were first struck at Pergamum after 228 bc; the reverse is a bow in a case between two serpents.

In the west the rise of Rome in the 3rd century introduced a new factor into the history of Greek coinage. The first coinage to disappear was that of [Etruria](https://www.britannica.com/place/Etruria-ancient-country-Italy) —a silver issue curiously always left blank on one side—after a life of two centuries. Rome’s early intercourse with the Greek cities of Italy is reflected in the Romano-Campanian coinage. In the south the Italian campaign of Pyrrhus left its [mark](https://www.britannica.com/money/mark-German-currency) on various coinages, notably at Tarentum. The towns of [Magna Graecia](https://www.britannica.com/place/Magna-Graecia) gradually lost their silver coinage under Roman influence, although Greek bronze coins lasted until the 1st century at Paestum.

In Sicily in the 3rd century, derivatives of earlier Syracusan coinage began to dominate the whole island. The [Punic Wars](https://www.britannica.com/event/Punic-Wars) brought the Romans to Sicily, where the Carthaginians had been established since the end of the 5th century and had struck coins of Syracusan and other Sicilian types with Punic legends and later with their own types. Sicily became a Roman province; henceforth, only bronze was struck in it, and these local coins continued into the first century, when the last trace of Greek coinage in the west disappeared.

## Subsidiary Greek silver coinages under the Roman Empire

Although Greek coins under the Roman Empire were nearly all of bronze and intended for local circulation, exceptional coinages in silver were allowed by Rome as a continuation, for wider regional use, of important preconquest currencies. The largest of these, running from Augustus to Diocletian’s coinage reform, was minted at Alexandria to supply the needs of Egypt and was generally of billon (an [alloy](https://www.britannica.com/technology/alloy) of silver and base metals). Inscriptions were in Greek and obverses bore the emperor’s portrait, while reverses (dated in regnal years by Greek numerals) showed a wide variety of types embracing Hellenistic, Roman, and Egyptian symbolism.

In [Syria](https://www.britannica.com/place/Syria) silver tetradrachms continued to be struck, mainly at Antioch but also at Tyre and some other mints. These gradually became baser in the course of the early 3rd century. Bronze was also struck by the Romans at these mints and frequently bears the letters *S C* (*Senatus consulto*), showing, like similar issues at Rome, imperial initiative exerted through senatorial agency. Of several other local silver coinages the large series of drachmas struck at Caesarea in Cappadocia from Tiberius to Commodus is the most important. The most usual type was a local one of Mount Argaeus.

A number of vassal states and protectorates continued to issue their own coinages in the precious metals until they became Roman provinces. The only [gold](https://www.britannica.com/science/gold-chemical-element) coinage of this kind is that of the kings of the [Bosporus](https://www.britannica.com/place/Kingdom-of-the-Bosporus), who struck coins from the time of Augustus to the beginning of the 4th century. This coinage became gradually debased. In Africa the kings of [Mauretania](https://www.britannica.com/place/Mauretania-region-North-Africa) issued their own gold and silver until ad 40.

## Coinage in Judaea

Another pre-imperial series continued under the Roman Empire was that of Judaea. Except for rare silver coins of much earlier date, with types of Greek origin but marked with brief Hebrew inscriptions, there were no Judaean issues until about 135 bc; the Seleucid coinage of Syria had in the meantime supplied the necessary currency. Antiochus VII, however, had granted to the Hasmonean high priest Simon Maccabeus the right of coinage, which enabled the natural resistance of the [Maccabees](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Maccabees) to Greek polytheism to be satisfied by the representation of specifically Jewish symbols. These coins, like those of the rest of the dynasty, were of [copper](https://www.britannica.com/science/copper). [Alexander Jannaeus](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Alexander-Jannaeus) (103–76 bc) was the first of the Maccabean priestly princes to style himself king on his coins, which bore his name and title in Greek as well as Hebrew, but Pompey’s withdrawal of the kingly title was reflected in the coins of [John Hyrcanus II](https://www.britannica.com/biography/John-Hyrcanus-II). [Antigonus Mattathias](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Antigonus-Mattathias) (40–37 bc), the last of the Maccabees, introduced the seven-branched candlestick as a type. Under the Herodian dynasty, from 37 bc, Greek alone was found on Judaean coins. [Herod Philip](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Philip-king-of-Judaea) (4 bc – ad 34) gravely infringed Jewish convention by showing the effigy of the Roman emperor; [Herod Agrippa I](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Herod-Agrippa-I) (41–44) was more adroit, avoiding the imperial portrait in Judaea but introducing his own in Caesarea.

From ad 66, silver shekels and halves were coined, with some bronze, at “Jerusalem the Holy” to mark the first [revolt](https://www.britannica.com/event/First-Jewish-Revolt) against Rome: issues of year 5 (ad 70–71), a precarious one for the insurgents, are very rare. After the Flavian conquest, there were no further Jewish coins until the second revolt (132–135), under [Bar Kokhba](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Bar-Kokhba-Jewish-leader), when silver and bronze briefly proclaimed “the redemption of Israel and the freedom of Jerusalem.” Jewish coinage ceased with the revolt’s collapse.

## Greek bronze imperial coinage, to ad 268

Under the Roman Republic many Greek cities and districts continued to issue their own bronze coins, and, particularly in Asia, these local Greek coinages went on under the empire down to Gallienus.

The right of coinage in Greece was sometimes continuous and sometimes intermittently permitted by the emperor or governor. Coins were struck not only by single towns but also jointly by alliances of towns (*homonoiai*). The general type is everywhere the same: obverse, a bust and, reverse, a type of local interest. Under the republic the Greek cities usually placed on the obverses of their coins an allegorical bust of some local hero, the local city goddess, or a personification of the people, the municipal council, or the senate. The [Tyche](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Tyche), the titular goddess of the city, appears as a female bust wearing a mural [crown](https://www.britannica.com/money/crown-monetary-unit). The goddess Roma is found as a helmeted female; e.g., at Smyrna. Under the empire the usual obverse type is the head of the emperor, as on the imperial series proper. There are some notable exceptions. Macedonia, for example, had the head of [Alexander the Great](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Alexander-the-Great). Athens was privileged by Hadrian to use the head of Athena in place of the emperor’s.

It is the reverse types of this series of coins that give them their importance. The coins of Athens preserve representations of many statues famous in antiquity that have long since perished, such as the Athena Parthenos of Phidias; the great Athena Promachos on the Acropolis, visible far out at sea; or the Dionysus of Alcamenes, possibly a pupil of Phidias. A coin of Elis preserves the Olympian [Zeus of Phidias](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Statue-of-Zeus), and one of Lacedaemon the [Apollo](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Apollo-Greek-mythology) of Amyclae, near Sparta. Local cults and incidents in the lives of the Greek divinities are common types. Local celebrities are also recorded, for example, [Homer](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Homer-Greek-poet) at several of the various towns that claimed him as a native (notably Smyrna), [Anacreon](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Anacreon) at Teos, [Sappho](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Sappho-Greek-poet) at Eresus in Lesbos, [Herodotus](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Herodotus-Greek-historian) at [Halicarnassus](https://www.britannica.com/place/Halicarnassus), and [Alcaeus](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Alcaeus) at Mytilene, which recorded on its coins a whole series of its famous men, most otherwise unknown. Reverse types also represent many architectural views of great importance, and the celebration of games and festivals is frequently recorded on coins.

In conclusion, mention may be made of a notable example of the preservation of a local tradition on a Greek imperial coin. On a coin of Septimius at Apameia in Phrygia there appear as reverse type a man and woman in a chest or ark floating on water, with a raven on the top and a dove flying above with a branch in its beak; to remove any doubt about the scene represented, the ark is labeled ΝΩ (NO; Noah), and the coin is evidence of the local tradition that the ark rested on the mountain behind Apameia.

## Roman coins, republic and empire

## The beginnings

Although Roman [coinage](https://www.britannica.com/money/coinage) soon diverged from Greek conventions, its origins were similar. Rome, founded in the 8th century bc, had no true coinage until the 3rd. Roman historians later attributed coinage unhesitatingly to the much earlier regal period: some derived *nummus* (“coin”) from [Numa Pompilius](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Numa-Pompilius), by tradition Rome’s second king, and [Servius Tullius](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Servius-Tullius) was credited with [silver](https://www.britannica.com/science/silver) coinage, as well as with [bronze](https://www.britannica.com/technology/bronze-alloy) stamped with the device of cattle. Roman historical tradition, however, seriously confused the elements of the true picture. Rough, unworked lumps of bronze (aes rude) were certainly used as a metal [currency](https://www.britannica.com/money/currency) from the 6th century, if not much earlier, perhaps in rare conjunction with very small quantities of unworked [gold](https://www.britannica.com/science/gold-chemical-element) and silver, themselves also passing by weight. Simultaneously, standards of value appear to have been expressed in terms of cattle and sheep, as is clear not only from the derivation of *pecunia* (“money”) from *pecus* (“cattle,” or “sheep”) but also from the early assessment of fines in oxen and sheep. From this it was falsely concluded that bronze coins marked with the device of cattle existed from the 6th century. In fact, the expression of values in terms of cattle may have lasted, officially, into the 5th century, for it was not until the decemvirs (a legislative commission) codified the law and drew up the [Twelve Tables](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Law-of-the-Twelve-Tables) (451–449 bc) that fines were fixed in bronze. This bronze still consisted of unworked lumps or, at most, rough bars of irregular weight.

During the 4th century bc, Roman contact with the Greek cities of southern Italy slowly increased; these included such prolific [mint](https://www.britannica.com/money/mint-metallurgy) cities as Nola, Hyria, and Naples. The coinages of these cities consisted of silver didrachms, of which Rome presumably made use in any necessary dealings with them. A hint is given, however, of widening Roman monetary interests by two issues of bronze token coinage. These, though certainly not produced at Rome, may perhaps be regarded as the earliest coins in the name of the Romans, struck at Naples about 325–285 within the terms of their alliance and intended for use in Campania, as distinct from Rome and Latium. It is unlikely, indeed, that a mint in the proper sense existed at Rome before 289, the year to which Pomponius assigned the establishment of *[tresviri](https://www.britannica.com/topic/triumvirate)* (a board of three officials) who should be *aeris flatores* (“bronze melters”); and this mint (in the temple of Juno Moneta) did not yet produce true coins but aes signatum, bronze bars (of about six pounds) lacking a [mark](https://www.britannica.com/money/mark-German-currency) of value but bearing on each side a clearly recognizable type (including cattle) and perhaps equivalent in value to a Greek silver didrachm.

These aes signatum bars were halfway between aes rude and true coinage. In 269 true coinage appeared. It consisted of aes grave, large circular cast coins of bronze all bearing marks of value, from the [as](https://www.britannica.com/topic/as) (weighing one pound) down to its 12th, the uncia; the obverses showed the head of a deity, the reverses a ship’s prow. These were paralleled at mints elsewhere by similar cast coins; their types showed not, as at Rome, Latin deities but rather Greek (in the south) or Umbrian and Oscan. At the same time, there appeared struck silver didrachms, on the standard of the Greek silver coins of Campania, bearing Greek types but marked *ROMANO* or *ROMA.* Accompanied by small struck bronze token coins, these were issued from Campanian mints, and they probably continued to the [Second Punic War](https://www.britannica.com/event/Second-Punic-War), terminating in a new issue of silver coins of Roman style and types (marked *ROMA*), including Jupiter in a quadriga (four-horse chariot) from which their name, quadrigati, derived; they were imitated in [electrum](https://www.britannica.com/science/electrum) by the Carthaginians in Capua. The quadrigati were of the weight of the lighter Romano-Campanian didrachms and reflected the rising cost of silver at a time of stress; concurrently the cast bronze coinage of Rome dropped steadily in weight from an as of one pound to one of three ounces or less. Financial stress is similarly to be seen in the exceptional issue of gold units and halves. Toward the end of the Second Punic War the quadrigati were replaced by silver coins of half their weight, with a Victory on the reverse, and hence called victoriates. By about 190 a mainly silver coinage, Latin-inscribed, was in production at Rome and other authorized mints, accompanied by bronze coinage so greatly reduced in standard (and thus size) that it could at last be struck instead of being cast.

Adjustment of the previously fluctuating relationship between bronze and silver was first secured by the issue about 211 bc of the silver denarius (marked *X* —i.e., 10 bronze asses), together with fractional coins, also of silver (marked *V* —i.e., five; and *IIS* —i.e., 2 1 / 2 asses—a sesterce, or sestertius). The denarii were lighter than the quadrigati; their types were a Roma head on the obverse, with the [Dioscuri](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Dioscuri) (the twin deities Castor and Pollux) and *ROMA* on the reverse. Their production came to be confined principally to the mint of Rome. The victoriates, again lighter (their weight standard had come from Illyria), were issued until about 150 bc, being perhaps intended for principal circulation outside Italy. The denarius, however, quickly established itself as the major currency in the central and western Mediterranean. In its eastward expansion, Rome learned to make use of local currencies—gold staters of Macedonia and silver tetradrachms of Athens or Asia. Rome was also prepared to employ Macedonian gold in the west, as was shown by the release to western markets of large quantities of gold staters after about 150 bc. In the 2nd century bc, Roman coinage in gold was exceptional. Coinage in bronze, however, continued, but further variation in silver–bronze values was seen in two developments. The as dropped in weight to that of an uncia and then less, becoming a token currency; together with its fractions, it was now always struck and not cast. The value of the denarius in terms of bronze was altered, being revalued about 133 at 16 instead of 10 asses; the silver quinarius (now of eight asses and with the types of the victoriate) became rare; and the silver [sesterce](https://www.britannica.com/topic/sesterce) (now equal to four asses) virtually disappeared. After about 80 bc the striking of bronze was discontinued until the time of Caesar.

These developments mirrored the economic difficulties of the day. Reduction of the weight of the as from one to 1 / 2 ounce in 89 bc was accompanied temporarily by debasement of the denarius, resulting in the issue of denarii with serrated edges, intended to show that they were not plated (*see* [plating](https://www.britannica.com/technology/plating)).

## Control and content of the coinage

The [coinage](https://www.britannica.com/money/coinage) was controlled by the Senate, acting for the sovereign people; and the conduct of the mints was in the hands of boards of junior magistrates, the *tresviri.* From about the mid-2nd century, each of a [mint’s](https://www.britannica.com/money/mint-metallurgy) three *tresviri* normally issued coins bearing his own name, and on special occasions these were supplemented by issues of quaestors, curule aediles, prefects, or praetors; these were distinguished by special inscriptions such as *ex s* (*enatus*) *c* (*onsulto*) and *ex a* (*rgento*) *p* (*ublico*)*.* The function of all these officials was quantity and quality control.

The moneyers’ names at first were shown as simple monograms. The Dioscuri reverse was followed by Diana or Victory in a biga (two-horse chariot), and these again by figures of Jupiter, Juno, or [Apollo](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Apollo-Greek-mythology) in a quadriga, with the moneyers’ names in fuller form. In the mid-2nd century bc, however, newer tendencies appeared, as when Sextus Pompeius Fostlus paired the Roma obverse with a reverse showing his traditional ancestor Faustulus discovering the wolf and twins; the reference was to the greatness of Rome, but it was to be seen through the lineage of a moneyer. Later republican denarii gave keen expression to party politics, as when corn ears recorded circa 100 the purchase of grain by the quaestors Piso and Caepio, or the head of Ceres with ploughing oxen proclaimed the program of the Marians, or Sextus Nonius Sufenas advertised the games that he had staged as praetor.

It was in the provinces, however, that the republican coinage took the decisive steps toward its finally imperial character. Campaigning generals began, in the 1st century bc, to operate mints for paying their troops in the field. In Italy mint policy had usually looked beyond personal politics to the state. But the military coinages of the *imperatores* equated the state with the personalities of the generals. Such were the aurei and denarii struck from eastern mints about 82–81 by [Sulla](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Sulla), with, obverse, *L. SVLLA* and head of Venus (his family patroness) and, reverse, *IMPER* (*ator*) *ITERVM,* priestly jug between trophies. [Pompey](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Pompey-the-Great) issued comparable aurei about 61 (also in the east). From these precedents the earlier coinage of Julius Caesar followed naturally in the late 50s and early 40s, with, obverse, *CAESAR* and elephant (the family badge) and, reverse, priestly symbols, or obverse, head of Venus (his traditional ancestress) and, reverse, *CAESAR,* Gaulish trophy, and captives. Such coinages still avoided the portraiture of a living man, the only examples of which hitherto had been on provincially struck coins.

## Caesar and after

In the last year of his life, [Caesar](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Julius-Caesar-Roman-ruler) developed personal control of the coinage to a point at which it lay ready to hand for Augustus to use later as a fully imperial instrument. Already, from 46 bc, coinage in [gold](https://www.britannica.com/science/gold-chemical-element) had been instituted in Rome by Caesar’s lieutenant [Hirtius](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Aulus-Hirtius). Caesar’s seizure of the treasury and his expansion of the annual board of moneyers from three to four members indicated his intention to deal absolutely with the coinage. In 44, denarii were issued in considerable quantity by his *quattuorviri,* bearing the portrait of Caesar on the obverse, with such inscriptions as *DICT* (*ator*) *QVART* (*um*) or *DICT* (*ator*) *PERPETVO,* and Venus Victrix or other semipersonal reverse types. For the token coinage a new [alloy](https://www.britannica.com/technology/alloy) was now first struck—yellow orichalcum or [brass](https://www.britannica.com/technology/brass-alloy), a copper–zinc alloy. Caesar may have enjoyed a monopoly of zinc from mines in [Cisalpine Gaul](https://www.britannica.com/place/Cisalpine-Gaul).

From 44 to 31, bronze coinages were struck at various non-Italian mints, notably in or around Sicily, by officials attached to the cause of one or other of the members of the second triumvirate— [Antony](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Mark-Antony-Roman-triumvir), Octavian, and Lepidus. But the principal issues of these years were of gold and [silver](https://www.britannica.com/science/silver). The mint of Rome continued its regular series until about 37 and then ceased. Antony’s coinage emanated at first from Gaul, then increasingly from eastern mints, including his cistophori and denarii (some showing his head conjoined with [Cleopatra](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Cleopatra-queen-of-Egypt) ’s) struck in Asia: his vast issue of often base denarii showing warships and military standards, shortly before the naval battle of Actium, was eastern. Octavian coined mainly in Gaul, Italy, and Africa. The piratical movement of Sextus Pompeius was reflected in the activity of a mint or mints in Sicily.

It was characteristic of most of the gold and silver after 44 that it showed portraits of the rival statesmen on the obverses, with reverses that alluded to their achievements or policies. This was true even of the “liberators” who murdered Caesar, for a famous eastern issue in the name of [Brutus](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Marcus-Junius-Brutus) showed his portrait, with *BRVT* (*us*) *IMP* (*erator*) on the obverse, with reverse *EID* (*ibus*) *MAR* (*tiis*)—the fatal Ides of March—and daggers flanking a cap of liberty. By the close of the Roman Republic, three factors had entirely transformed the originally simple idiom of the early denarial coinage: gold was freely struck in addition to silver; the types of both were personal to military leaders and included living portraiture; and coinage could be produced elsewhere than at Rome.

## Early imperial mint policy

[Augustus](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Augustus-Roman-emperor) (27 bc – ad 14) based the [coinage](https://www.britannica.com/money/coinage) on the [aureus](https://www.britannica.com/topic/aureus) of 1 / 42 of a pound of [gold](https://www.britannica.com/science/gold-chemical-element), equivalent to 25 denarii, each of 1 / 84 of a pound of [silver](https://www.britannica.com/science/silver), the metals being struck almost pure. The denarius was valued at 16 asses. Token coinage consisted henceforth of brass sesterces and dupondii (equal to four and two asses, respectively), with [copper](https://www.britannica.com/science/copper) asses, halves, and quarters, the as being the most common. [Nero](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Nero-Roman-emperor) in ad 64 lightened aureus and denarius to 1 / 45 and 1 / 96, respectively, but debasement of silver subsequently took place. Under [Septimius Severus](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Septimius-Severus) it reached 40 percent, and Caracalla issued a debased double denarius of the weight of only 1 1 / 2 denarii. Gallienus’ double denarius of copper and silver, leached to give a more silver-rich surface, marked a monetary breakdown, only partially cured when Diocletian and Constantine again made gold the firm basis for supplementary pure silver and abundant copper coinage.

Augustus’ earliest gold and silver were coined chiefly in the east—e.g., at Ephesus and Pergamum—and more briefly at Emerita in Spain. Bronze also was mainly eastern, though some was struck at Nemausus (Nîmes). The Rome [mint](https://www.britannica.com/money/mint-metallurgy) was reopened about 20 bc for gold and silver and remained open for this purpose until about 12 bc; its bronze continued irregularly. From 12 bc, Lugdunum ([Lyon](https://www.britannica.com/place/Lyon-France)), with other mints of uncertain identity, undertook the main western coinages in gold, silver, and bronze. After 64 Rome was once more the chief mint for all metals. Official mintages were supplemented by a mass of regional or local coinages, while official coinages from eastern mints provided necessary [currency](https://www.britannica.com/money/currency) for local Roman frontier forces.

The bronze of Rome was marked *S* (*enatus*) *C* (*onsulto*) and continued to bear the names of the *tresviri monetales* —masters of the mint, now reduced to their traditional number—until 4 bc. But *S C* also appeared on bronze from Lyon and Antioch in imperial provinces, showing that whatever nominal senatorial rights of coinage still lingered on—the *tresviri* are known until the 3rd century—the emperor wielded effective control over all metals everywhere. This was logical, since his economic powers were equally comprehensive. In fact, the old senatorial mint was transferred from the temple of Juno Moneta on Rome’s Capitoline Hill and merged, probably after the fire of 64, with an imperial mint for gold and silver elsewhere in the capital. Henceforth, it worked in sections—six were normal later—controlled immediately by an imperial procurator and staffed by slaves or freedmen.

## Portraits and types

The use of Caesar’s own portrait upon coinage set a precedent; although under Augustus and Tiberius token denominations occasionally lacked the imperial portrait, it was thereafter an essential element of virtually every gold, silver, and bronze coin of the official mints, as also of nearly all provincial and local coins. Emphasis on the personality of the emperor (extended sometimes to empresses, sons, or deceased members of the imperial house) was a powerful propaganda instrument in a coinage that circulated throughout a vast empire. The great series of imperial portraits, from Augustus to Romulus in ad 476, is artistically outstanding. Many of the finest appeared on the large brass sesterces down to the 3rd century and on the even larger bronze medallions produced for presentation; but particular care was taken over the portraits for gold, which, being softer, showed a beautiful and highly sensitive impression. Nothing is known of the portrait artists, though it is likely that they were often from the Greek East.

Imperial reverse types, if artistically less remarkable, are uniquely important for the unparalleled fullness of the historical commentary that they supply. The major mints provided annual evidence of imperial interests: victories in war; frontier defense (e.g., *Rex Parthis datus* —“A king is given to the Parthians”—of Trajan); a well-earned peace (e.g., the *Pace terra marique parta Ianum clusit* —“There being peace on land and sea, the doors of the Temple of Janus were closed”—of Nero); the birth of an heir or alternative provision for the succession; public shows; acts of social reform or public relief (e.g., *Civitatibus Asiae restitutis* —“For the restitution of the citizenries of Asia”); imperial journeys (e.g., *Adventus Augusti* —“The arrival of the emperor”); and religious or other anniversaries (e.g., the *Felix temporum reparatio* —“Happy days are here again”—on Rome’s 1,100th birthday). Their interpretation demands care, since, being selected by imperial officials, their tenor can conflict with the attitude of anti-imperial historians. But they show the efforts made by emperors, as the omnipotent semireligious heads of a huge and heterogeneous empire, to conciliate and inform. They contributed powerfully to the growing conception of an eternal Roman empire, seen no less in the special types of eagle (the soul flown heavenward) or funeral pyre or temple in honour of “good” emperors consecrated as *divi* than in the annual record of military victory, economic security, and provincial peace and implicit in the regularity of imperial succession. The normal colour given to this imperial program was religious, for the coinage types commonly embraced such characteristically Roman concepts as Aequitas (Justice), Fides (Faith), and Concordia (Harmony)—social virtues operating in the guise of minor deities.

## The 4th century and after

[Diocletian](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Diocletian) ’s institution of the [tetrarchy](https://www.britannica.com/topic/tetrarch-ancient-Greek-official), by which the empire was divided administratively between two Augusti and two Caesars, brought fundamental changes in social and economic policy; the instability of prices called for complete renewal of the monetary system. His coinage reforms took place in stages from about 286 to about 296. First, new aurei were struck at 60 to the pound of gold. Then, about 293–294, new silver coins, of good purity, were struck at the revised Neronian weight of 96 to the pound of silver. Finally, about 294–296, new copper coins appeared that were larger and intrinsically more valuable than the small debased double denarii of previous reigns. The contemporary names of these silver and copper pieces are not known. This reformed coinage was struck at a variety of mints from Londinium (London) to Alexandria, most of which coined in all three metals. Types were closely controlled in the silver and copper coinage; in the latter the almost universal type was for some years that of the “Genius Populi Romani.” The obverse bore the portrait of one or other of the tetrarchs, each of whom coined with portraits of all four.

The breakdown of the tetrarchy after 306 weakened the new system. Copper was quickly and steadily lightened, and silver struck very sparingly. Gold, however, continued in good supply; and though Constantine’s solidus showed a reduced weight standard, there was no shortage of gold throughout the rest of the 4th century. In time, silver coinage increased, especially after about 350, when the miliarense (1/1,000 of a gold pound) and smaller denominations appeared. By the end of the 4th century, however, the size of copper coins had dropped very sharply, and in the 5th, until the Western Empire collapsed in ad 476, the western coinage consisted finally of gold with a little silver, struck mainly from the mints of Ravenna and Rome.

From 312, when [Constantine](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Constantine-I-Roman-emperor) became emperor of the West, coin types began to show new tendencies. The imperial portrait was still the dominant feature. Reverses displayed complementary themes—the glory of the army, vows for continued imperial rule, the constant struggle against barbarian pressure on the frontiers. The old variety of pagan gods—Jupiter excepted—mainly disappeared, though Sol, popular from Aurelian onward, was used, especially by Constantine. Christian emblems did little to take their place, though the Christian monogram, the Greek letters chi and rho superimposed, sometimes on a standard, began to appear with Constantine and was combined with the alpha and omega under [Constantius II](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Constantius-II) and Magnentius. On the whole, however, there was an unavowed truce between Christianity and paganism, only occasionally broken, as when Julian revived a range of pagan types; the full development of the Christian tradition in coinage was reserved for Byzantium.
