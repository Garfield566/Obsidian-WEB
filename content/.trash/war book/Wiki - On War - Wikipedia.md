***Vom Kriege*** (German pronunciation: [\[fɔm ˈkʁiːɡə\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:IPA/Standard_German "Help:IPA/Standard German")) is a book on [war](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War "War") and [military strategy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_strategy "Military strategy") by [Prussian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prussia "Prussia") general [Carl von Clausewitz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_von_Clausewitz "Carl von Clausewitz") (1780–1831), written mostly after the [Napoleonic wars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Napoleonic_wars "Napoleonic wars"), between 1816 and 1830, and published posthumously by his wife [Marie von Brühl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marie_von_Br%C3%BChl "Marie von Brühl") in 1832.<sup id="cite_ref-Cla08_1-0" class="reference"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-Cla08-1"><span class="cite-bracket">[</span>1<span class="cite-bracket">]</span></a></sup> It is one of the most important treatises on political-military analysis and strategy ever written, and remains both controversial and influential on [military strategic thinking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_strategy "Military strategy").<sup id="cite_ref-Cla08_1-1" class="reference"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-Cla08-1"><span class="cite-bracket">[</span>1<span class="cite-bracket">]</span></a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-2"><span class="cite-bracket">[</span>2<span class="cite-bracket">]</span></a></sup>

*Vom Kriege* has been translated into English several times as ***On War***. *On War* is an unfinished work. Clausewitz had set about revising his accumulated manuscripts in 1827, but did not live to finish the task. His wife edited his collected works and published them between 1832 and 1835.<sup id="cite_ref-Holmes2010_3-0" class="reference"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-Holmes2010-3"><span class="cite-bracket">[</span>3<span class="cite-bracket">]</span></a></sup>

His ten-volume collected works contain most of his larger historical and theoretical writings, though not his shorter articles and papers or his extensive correspondence with important political, military, intellectual and cultural leaders in the [Prussian state](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prussia "Prussia"). *On War* is formed by the first three volumes and represents his theoretical explorations.

## History

\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=On_War&action=edit&section=1 "Edit section: History")\]

Clausewitz was among those intrigued by the manner in which the leaders of the [French Revolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Revolution "French Revolution"), especially [Napoleon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Napoleon "Napoleon"), changed the conduct of war through their ability to motivate the populace and gain access to the full resources of the state, thus unleashing war on a greater scale than had previously been seen in Europe. Clausewitz believed that moral forces in battle had a significant influence on its outcome. Clausewitz was well-educated and had strong interests in art, history, science, and education. He was a professional soldier who spent a considerable part of his life fighting against Napoleon. In his lifetime, he had experienced both the [French Revolutionary Army](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Revolutionary_Army "French Revolutionary Army")'s (1792—1802) zeal and the conscripted armies employed by the [French crown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emperor_of_the_French "Emperor of the French"). The insights he gained from his political and military experiences, combined with a solid grasp of European history, provided the basis for his work.<sup id="cite_ref-Cla08_1-2" class="reference"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-Cla08-1"><span class="cite-bracket">[</span>1<span class="cite-bracket">]</span></a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-Holmes2010_3-1" class="reference"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-Holmes2010-3"><span class="cite-bracket">[</span>3<span class="cite-bracket">]</span></a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-4"><span class="cite-bracket">[</span>4<span class="cite-bracket">]</span></a></sup>

A wealth of historical examples is used to illustrate its various ideas. Napoleon and [Frederick the Great](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frederick_II_of_Prussia "Frederick II of Prussia") figure prominently for having made very efficient use of the terrain, movement and the forces at their disposal.

Regarding Clausewitz’s intellectual-cultural background, [Azar Gat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Azar_Gat "Azar Gat") argues that he expressed in the field of military theory the main themes of the [Romantic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romanticism "Romanticism") reaction against the worldview of the [Enlightenment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Age_of_Enlightenment "Age of Enlightenment"), rejecting universal principles and stressing historical diversity and the forces of the human spirit. This explains the strength and value of many of his arguments, derived from this great cultural movement, but also his often harsh rhetoric against his predecessors.<sup id="cite_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-5"><span class="cite-bracket">[</span>5<span class="cite-bracket">]</span></a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-:0_6-0" class="reference"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/:0-6"><span class="cite-bracket">[</span>6<span class="cite-bracket">]</span></a></sup>

## Clausewitz's theory

\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=On_War&action=edit&section=2 "Edit section: Clausewitz's theory")\]

![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/ca/Clausewitz-Vom-Kriege-9061.tif/lossy-page1-300px-Clausewitz-Vom-Kriege-9061.tif.jpg)

An operational map for [Napoleon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Napoleon "Napoleon")'s military expedition to Italy, 1796. Map from Clausewitz: *Vom Kriege*, 1857.

### Definition of war

\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=On_War&action=edit&section=3 "Edit section: Definition of war")\]

Clausewitz argued that war theory cannot be a strict operational advice for generals.<sup id="cite_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/"><span class="cite-bracket">[</span>7<span class="cite-bracket">]</span></a></sup> Instead, he wanted to highlight general principles that would result from the study of history and logical thinking. He contended that military campaigns could be planned only to a very small degree because incalculable influences or events, so-called *friction*, would quickly make any too-detailed planning in advance obsolete. Military leaders must be capable to make decisions under time pressure with incomplete information since in his opinion "three quarters of the things on which action is built in war" are concealed and distorted by the *[fog of war](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fog_of_war "Fog of war")*.<sup id="cite_ref-Savkin1974_8-0" class="reference"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-Savkin1974-8"><span class="cite-bracket">[</span>8<span class="cite-bracket">]</span></a></sup>

In his 1812 *Bekenntnisschrift* ("Notes of Confession"), he presents a more existential interpretation of war by envisioning war as the highest form of self-assertion by a people. That corresponded in every respect with the spirit of the time when the French Revolution and the conflicts that arose from it had caused the evolution of conscript armies and guerrillas. The people's armies supported the idea that war is an existential struggle.<sup id="cite_ref-Cobb1987_9-0" class="reference"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-Cobb1987-9"><span class="cite-bracket">[</span>9<span class="cite-bracket">]</span></a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-Hagemann2015_10-0" class="reference"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-Hagemann2015-10"><span class="cite-bracket">[</span>10<span class="cite-bracket">]</span></a></sup>

During the following years, however, Clausewitz gradually abandoned this exalted view and concluded that the war served as a mere instrument: "Thus, war is an act of violence in order to force our will upon the enemy."<sup id="cite_ref-Clausewitz2010_11-0" class="reference"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-Clausewitz2010-11"><span class="cite-bracket">[</span>11<span class="cite-bracket">]</span></a></sup>

### Purpose, goal and means

\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=On_War&action=edit&section=4 "Edit section: Purpose, goal and means")\]

Clausewitz analyzed the conflicts of his time along the line of the categories *Purpose*, *Goal* and *Means*. He reasoned that the *Purpose* of war is one's will to be enforced, which is determined by politics. The *Goal* of the conflict is therefore to defeat the opponent in order to exact the *Purpose*. The *Goal* is pursued with the help of a strategy, that might be brought about by various *Means* such as by the defeat or the elimination of opposing armed forces or by non-military *Means* (such as propaganda, economic sanctions and political isolation). Thus, any resource of the human body and mind and all the moral and physical powers of a state might serve as *Means* to achieve the set goal.<sup id="cite_ref-12" class="reference"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/"><span class="cite-bracket">[</span>12<span class="cite-bracket">]</span></a></sup>

One of Clausewitz's best-known quotes summarizes that idea: "War is the continuation of policy with other means."<sup id="cite_ref-Clausewitz2010_11-1" class="reference"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-Clausewitz2010-11"><span class="cite-bracket">[</span>11<span class="cite-bracket">]</span></a></sup>

That quote in itself allows for the interpretation that the military will take over from politics as soon as war has begun (as, for example, the [German General Staff](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_General_Staff "German General Staff") did during [World War I](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_I "World War I")). However, Clausewitz had postulated the *primacy of politics* and in this context elaborated: "\[...\], we claim that war is nothing more than a continuation of the political process by applying other means. By applying other means we simultaneously assert that the political process does not end with the conclusion of the war or is being transformed into something entirely different, but that it continues to exist and proceed in its essence, regardless of the structure of the means it makes use of \[...\]."<sup id="cite_ref-13" class="reference"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/"><span class="cite-bracket">[</span>13<span class="cite-bracket">]</span></a></sup>

According to [Azar Gat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Azar_Gat "Azar Gat"), the "general message" of the book was that "the conduct of war could not be reduced to universal principles \[and is\] dominated by political decisions and moral forces."<sup id="cite_ref-14" class="reference"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/"><span class="cite-bracket">[</span>14<span class="cite-bracket">]</span></a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-15" class="reference"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/"><span class="cite-bracket">[</span>15<span class="cite-bracket">]</span></a></sup> These basic conclusions are essential to Clausewitz's theory:

- War must never be seen as having any purpose in itself but should be seen as a political instrument: "War is not merely a political act, but a real political instrument, a continuation of the political process, an application by other means."<sup id="cite_ref-16" class="reference"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/"><span class="cite-bracket">[</span>16<span class="cite-bracket">]</span></a></sup>
- The military objectives in war that support one's political objectives fall into two broad types: "war to achieve limited aims" and war to "disarm" the enemy: "to render \[him\] politically helpless or militarily impotent."
- All else being equal, the course of war will tend to favor the party with the stronger emotional and political motivations, especially the defender.<sup id="cite_ref-Cla08_1-3" class="reference"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-Cla08-1"><span class="cite-bracket">[</span>1<span class="cite-bracket">]</span></a></sup>

Some of the key ideas (not necessarily original to Clausewitz or even to his mentor, [Gerhard von Scharnhorst](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerhard_von_Scharnhorst "Gerhard von Scharnhorst")) discussed in *On War* include<sup id="cite_ref-17" class="reference"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/"><span class="cite-bracket">[</span>17<span class="cite-bracket">]</span></a></sup> (in no particular order of importance):

- the methods of "critical analysis"
- the uses and abuses of historical studies
- the nature of the balance-of-power mechanism
- the relationship between political objectives and military objectives in war
- the asymmetrical relationship between attack and defense

- the "fascinating trinity" (*Wunderliche Dreifaltigkeit*) of war
- philosophical distinctions between "absolute or ideal war," and "real war"
- in "real war," the distinctive poles of a) limited war and b) war to "render the enemy helpless"
- "war" belongs fundamentally to the social realm, rather than to the realms of art or science
- "strategy" belongs primarily to the realm of art
- "tactics" belongs primarily to the realm of science
- the essential unpredictability of war
- simplicity: Everything is very simple in war, but the simplest thing is difficult. These difficulties accumulate.<sup id="cite_ref-19" class="reference"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-19"><span class="cite-bracket">[</span>19<span class="cite-bracket">]</span></a></sup> The strength of any strategy lies in its simplicity.<sup id="cite_ref-20" class="reference"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-20"><span class="cite-bracket">[</span>20<span class="cite-bracket">]</span></a></sup>

## Influence and Conflicting Interpretations

\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=On_War&action=edit&section=5 "Edit section: Influence and Conflicting Interpretations")\]

Modern perceptions of war are based on the concepts that Clausewitz put forth in *On War*, but they have been diversely interpreted by various leaders (such as [Moltke](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moltke_the_Elder "Moltke the Elder"), [Vladimir Lenin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vladimir_Lenin "Vladimir Lenin"), [Dwight Eisenhower](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dwight_Eisenhower "Dwight Eisenhower"), and [Mao Zedong](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mao_Zedong "Mao Zedong")), thinkers, armies, and peoples. Modern military doctrine, organization, and norms are all still based on Napoleonic premises, but whether the premises are necessarily also "Clausewitzian" is debatable.<sup id="cite_ref-Meilinger2020_21-0" class="reference"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-Meilinger2020-21"><span class="cite-bracket">[</span>21<span class="cite-bracket">]</span></a></sup>

Some prominent critics have interpreted *On War* as an argument for "[total war](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Total_war "Total war")".<sup class="citation nobold" id="ref_Anone"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/#endnote_Anone">[a]</a></sup> The book has been blamed for the level of destruction involved in the First and the Second World Wars, but it seems rather that Clausewitz (who did not actually use the term "total war") had merely foreseen the inevitable developments that started with the huge, patriotically motivated armies of the Napoleonic era.<sup class="noprint Inline-Template Template-Fact" style="white-space:nowrap;">[<i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources. (December 2022)">citation needed</span></a></i>]</sup> These developments resulted (though the evolution of war has not yet ended) in the atomic bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, with all the forces and capabilities of the state devoted to destroying forces and capabilities of the enemy state (thus "total war"). Conversely, Clausewitz has also been seen as "The preeminent military and political strategist of limited war in modern times".<sup id="cite_ref-22" class="reference"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-22"><span class="cite-bracket">[</span>22<span class="cite-bracket">]</span></a></sup>

The "dualism" of Clausewitz's view of war (that wars can vary a great deal between the two "poles" that he proposed, based on the political objectives of the opposing sides and the context) seems to be simple enough, but few commentators have been willing to accept that crucial variability<sup class="noprint Inline-Template Template-Fact" style="white-space:nowrap;">[<i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources. (December 2022)">citation needed</span></a></i>]</sup>. They insist that Clausewitz "really" argued for one end of the scale or the other. Clausewitz's use of a dialectical method to construct his argument, led to frequent modern misinterpretation because he allegedly explores various often-opposed ideas before he came to conclusions.

However, according to Gat, the opposing interpretations of Clausewitz are rooted in Clausewitz’s own conceptual journey.<sup id="cite_ref-:0_6-1" class="reference"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/:0-6"><span class="cite-bracket">[</span>6<span class="cite-bracket">]</span></a></sup> The centerpiece of Clausewitz’s theory of war throughout his life was his concept of all-out fighting and energetic conduct leading to the great battle of annihilation. He believed such conduct expressed the very “nature”, or “lasting spirit” of war. Accordingly, Clausewitz disparaged the significance of the [maneuver](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maneuver_warfare "Maneuver warfare"), surprise, and cunning in war, as distracting from the centrality of [battle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle "Battle"),<sup id="cite_ref-23" class="reference"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/"><span class="cite-bracket">[</span>23<span class="cite-bracket">]</span></a></sup> and argued that defense was legitimate only if and as long as one was weaker than the enemy.<sup id="cite_ref-24" class="reference"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/"><span class="cite-bracket">[</span>24<span class="cite-bracket">]</span></a></sup> Nevertheless, in the last years of his life, after the first six out of the eight books of *On War* had already been drafted, Clausewitz came to recognize that this concept was not universal and did not even apply to the [Napoleonic Wars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Napoleonic_Wars "Napoleonic Wars"), the supreme model of his theory of war. This was demonstrated by the [Spanish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peninsular_War "Peninsular War") and [Russian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_invasion_of_Russia "French invasion of Russia") campaigns and by [guerrilla warfare](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guerrilla_warfare "Guerrilla warfare"), in all of which battle was systematically avoided. Consequently, from 1827 on, Clausewitz recognized the legitimacy of [limited war](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limited_war "Limited war") and explained it by the influence of politics that harnessed the unlimited nature of war to serve its objectives. Clausewitz died in 1831 before he completed the revision he planned along these lines. He incorporated his new ideas only into the end of Book VI, Book VIII and the beginning of Book I of *On War*. As a result, when published, *On War* encompassed both his old and new ideas, at odds with each other.

Thus, against common interpretations of *On War*, Gat points out that Clausewitz’s transformed views regarding the relationship between politics and war and the admission of limited war into his theory constituted a U-turn against his own life-long fundamental view of the nature of war. Gat further argues the readers’ miscomprehension of the theory in *On War* as complete and dialectical, rather than a draft undergoing a radical change of mind, has thus generated a range of reactions. People of each age have found in *On War* the Clausewitz who suited their own views on war and its conduct. Between 1870 and 1914, he was celebrated mainly for his insistence on the clash of forces and the decisive battle, and his emphasis on moral forces. By contrast, after 1945, during the [nuclear age](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_Age "Atomic Age"), his reputation has reached a second pinnacle for his later acceptance of the primacy of politics and the concept of limited war.

## Criticism

\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=On_War&action=edit&section=6 "Edit section: Criticism")\]

Clausewitz and his proponents have been severely criticized by other military theorists, like [Antoine-Henri Jomini](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antoine-Henri_Jomini "Antoine-Henri Jomini")<sup id="cite_ref-25" class="reference"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/"><span class="cite-bracket">[</span>25<span class="cite-bracket">]</span></a></sup> in the 19th century, [B. H. Liddell Hart](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B._H._Liddell_Hart "B. H. Liddell Hart")<sup id="cite_ref-26" class="reference"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/"><span class="cite-bracket">[</span>26<span class="cite-bracket">]</span></a></sup> in the mid-20th century, and [Martin van Creveld](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_van_Creveld "Martin van Creveld")<sup id="cite_ref-macr_27-0" class="reference"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-macr-27"><span class="cite-bracket">[</span>27<span class="cite-bracket">]</span></a></sup> and [John Keegan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Keegan "John Keegan")<sup id="cite_ref-28" class="reference"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/"><span class="cite-bracket">[</span>28<span class="cite-bracket">]</span></a></sup> more recently.<sup id="cite_ref-29" class="reference"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/"><span class="cite-bracket">[</span>29<span class="cite-bracket">]</span></a></sup> *On War* is a work rooted solely in the world of the [nation state](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nation_state "Nation state"), states historian Martin van Creveld, who alleges that Clausewitz takes the state "almost for granted", as he rarely looks at anything before the 1648 [Peace of Westphalia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peace_of_Westphalia "Peace of Westphalia"), and mediaeval warfare is effectively ignored in Clausewitz's theory.<sup id="cite_ref-macr_27-1" class="reference"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-macr-27"><span class="cite-bracket">[</span>27<span class="cite-bracket">]</span></a></sup> He alleges that Clausewitz does not address any form of intra/supra-state conflict, such as rebellion and revolution, because he could not theoretically account for warfare before the existence of the state.<sup id="cite_ref-Cormier_2013_30-0" class="reference"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-Cormier_2013-30"><span class="cite-bracket">[</span>30<span class="cite-bracket">]</span></a></sup>

Previous kinds of conflict were demoted to criminal activities without legitimacy and not worthy of the label "war". Van Creveld argues that "Clausewitzian war" requires the state to act in conjunction with the people and the army, the state becoming a massive engine built to exert military force against an identical opponent. He supports that statement by pointing to the conventional armies in existence throughout the 20th century. However, revolutionaries like [Karl Marx](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl_Marx "Karl Marx") and [Friedrich Engels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friedrich_Engels "Friedrich Engels") derived some inspiration from Clausewitzian ideas.<sup id="cite_ref-Cormier_2013_30-1" class="reference"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-Cormier_2013-30"><span class="cite-bracket">[</span>30<span class="cite-bracket">]</span></a></sup>

Referring to much of the current interpretation of *On War* as the [Emperor’s New Clothes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Emperor%27s_New_Clothes "The Emperor's New Clothes") syndrome, Gat argues that instead of critically addressing the puzzling contradictions in *On War,* Clausewitz has been set in stone and could not be wrong.<sup id="cite_ref-:0_6-2" class="reference"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/:0-6"><span class="cite-bracket">[</span>6<span class="cite-bracket">]</span></a></sup>
