**John Maynard Keynes, 1st Baron Keynes**<sup id="cite_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/"><span class="cite-bracket">[</span>6<span class="cite-bracket">]</span></a></sup> [CB](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Companion_of_the_Order_of_the_Bath "Companion of the Order of the Bath"), [FBA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fellow_of_the_British_Academy "Fellow of the British Academy") ([/keɪnz/](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:IPA/English "Help:IPA/English") [*KAYNZ*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:Pronunciation_respelling_key "Help:Pronunciation respelling key"); 5 June 1883 – 21 April 1946), was an English economist and philosopher whose ideas fundamentally changed the theory and practice of [macroeconomics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macroeconomics "Macroeconomics") and the [economic policies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_policies "Economic policies") of governments. Originally trained in mathematics, he built on and greatly refined earlier work on the causes of [business cycles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_cycle "Business cycle").<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEYerginStanislaw200239–42_7-0" class="reference"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-FOOTNOTEYerginStanislaw200239%E2%80%9342-7"><span class="cite-bracket">[</span>7<span class="cite-bracket">]</span></a></sup> One of the most influential economists of the 20th century,<sup id="cite_ref-JMK_8-0" class="reference"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-JMK-8"><span class="cite-bracket">[</span>8<span class="cite-bracket">]</span></a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-9"><span class="cite-bracket">[</span>9<span class="cite-bracket">]</span></a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-10" class="reference"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/"><span class="cite-bracket">[</span>10<span class="cite-bracket">]</span></a></sup> he produced writings that are the basis for the [school of thought](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schools_of_economic_thought "Schools of economic thought") known as [Keynesian economics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keynesian_economics "Keynesian economics"), and its various offshoots.<sup id="cite_ref-11" class="reference"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-11"><span class="cite-bracket">[</span>11<span class="cite-bracket">]</span></a></sup> His ideas, reformulated as [New Keynesianism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Keynesianism "New Keynesianism"), are fundamental to [mainstream macroeconomics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mainstream_economics "Mainstream economics"). He is known as the "father of macroeconomics".<sup id="cite_ref-12" class="reference"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/"><span class="cite-bracket">[</span>12<span class="cite-bracket">]</span></a></sup>

During the [Great Depression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Depression "Great Depression") of the 1930s, Keynes spearheaded [a revolution in economic thinking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keynesian_Revolution "Keynesian Revolution"), challenging the ideas of [neoclassical economics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neoclassical_economics "Neoclassical economics") that held that [free markets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_market "Free market") would, in the short to medium term, automatically provide full employment, as long as workers were flexible in their wage demands. He argued that [aggregate demand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aggregate_demand "Aggregate demand") (total spending in the economy) determined the overall level of economic activity, and that inadequate aggregate demand could lead to prolonged periods of high unemployment, and since wages and labour costs are [rigid downwards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nominal_rigidity "Nominal rigidity") the economy will not automatically rebound to full employment.<sup id="cite_ref-gen_theory_13-0" class="reference"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-gen_theory-13"><span class="cite-bracket">[</span>13<span class="cite-bracket">]</span></a></sup> Keynes advocated the use of [fiscal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiscal_policy "Fiscal policy") and [monetary policies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monetary_policies "Monetary policies") to mitigate the adverse effects of economic [recessions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recession "Recession") and [depressions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depression_\(economics\) "Depression (economics)"). After the 1929 crisis, Keynes also turned away from a fundamental pillar of neoclassical economics: [free trade](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_trade "Free trade"). He criticized Ricardian [comparative advantage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparative_advantage "Comparative advantage") theory (the foundation of free trade), considering the theory's initial assumptions unrealistic, and became definitively protectionist.<sup id="cite_ref-Maurin_free_14-0" class="reference"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-Maurin_free-14"><span class="cite-bracket">[</span>14<span class="cite-bracket">]</span></a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-Maurin_thesis_15-0" class="reference"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-Maurin_thesis-15"><span class="cite-bracket">[</span>15<span class="cite-bracket">]</span></a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-National_Self-Sufficiency_16-0" class="reference"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-National_Self-Sufficiency-16"><span class="cite-bracket">[</span>16<span class="cite-bracket">]</span></a></sup> He detailed these ideas in his magnum opus, *[The General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_General_Theory_of_Employment,_Interest_and_Money "The General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money")*, published in early 1936. By the late 1930s, leading Western economies had begun adopting Keynes's policy recommendations. Almost all [capitalist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capitalist "Capitalist") governments had done so by the end of the two decades following Keynes's death in 1946. As a leader of the British delegation, Keynes participated in the design of the international economic institutions established after the end of [World War II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II "World War II") but was overruled by the American delegation on several aspects.

Keynes's influence started to wane in the 1970s, partly as a result of the [stagflation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stagflation "Stagflation") that plagued the [British](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_the_United_Kingdom "Economy of the United Kingdom") and [American economies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_the_United_States "Economy of the United States") during that decade, and partly because of criticism of Keynesian policies by [Milton Friedman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milton_Friedman "Milton Friedman") and other [monetarists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monetarist "Monetarist"),<sup id="cite_ref-17" class="reference"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/"><span class="cite-bracket">[</span>17<span class="cite-bracket">]</span></a></sup> who disputed the ability of government to favourably regulate the business cycle with [fiscal policy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiscal_policy "Fiscal policy").<sup id="cite_ref-18" class="reference"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/"><span class="cite-bracket">[</span>18<span class="cite-bracket">]</span></a></sup> The [2008 financial crisis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2008_financial_crisis "2008 financial crisis") sparked the [2008–2009 Keynesian resurgence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2008%E2%80%932009_Keynesian_resurgence "2008–2009 Keynesian resurgence"). Keynesian economics provided the theoretical underpinning for economic policies undertaken in response to the [2008 financial crisis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2008_financial_crisis "2008 financial crisis") by President [Barack Obama](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barack_Obama "Barack Obama") of the United States, Prime Minister [Gordon Brown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gordon_Brown "Gordon Brown") of the United Kingdom, and other heads of governments.<sup id="cite_ref-19" class="reference"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-19"><span class="cite-bracket">[</span>19<span class="cite-bracket">]</span></a></sup>

When *[Time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_\(magazine\) "Time (magazine)")* magazine included Keynes among its [Most Important People of the Century](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_100:_The_Most_Important_People_of_the_Century "Time 100: The Most Important People of the Century") in 1999, it reported that "his radical idea that governments should spend money they don't have may have saved capitalism".<sup id="cite_ref-20" class="reference"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-20"><span class="cite-bracket">[</span>20<span class="cite-bracket">]</span></a></sup> *[The Economist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Economist "The Economist")* has described Keynes as "Britain's most famous 20th-century economist".<sup id="cite_ref-21" class="reference"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-21"><span class="cite-bracket">[</span>21<span class="cite-bracket">]</span></a></sup> In addition to being an economist, Keynes was also a [civil servant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_Service_\(United_Kingdom\) "Civil Service (United Kingdom)"), a director of the [Bank of England](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_of_England "Bank of England"), and a part of the [Bloomsbury Group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloomsbury_Group "Bloomsbury Group") of intellectuals.<sup id="cite_ref-The_Bloomsbury_Group_22-0" class="reference"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-The_Bloomsbury_Group-22"><span class="cite-bracket">[</span>22<span class="cite-bracket">]</span></a></sup>

## Career

In October 1906 Keynes began his [Civil Service](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_Service_\(United_Kingdom\) "Civil Service (United Kingdom)") career as a clerk in the [India Office](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India_Office "India Office").<sup id="cite_ref-33" class="reference"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/"><span class="cite-bracket">[</span>33<span class="cite-bracket">]</span></a></sup> He enjoyed his work at first, but by 1908 had become bored and resigned his position to return to Cambridge and work on [probability theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability_theory "Probability theory"), through a lectureship in economics at first funded personally by economists [Alfred Marshall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfred_Marshall "Alfred Marshall") and [Arthur Pigou](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_Cecil_Pigou "Arthur Cecil Pigou"); he became a fellow of [King's College](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King%27s_College,_Cambridge "King's College, Cambridge") in 1909.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTESkidelsky1983205_34-0" class="reference"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-FOOTNOTESkidelsky1983205-34"><span class="cite-bracket">[</span>34<span class="cite-bracket">]</span></a></sup>

By 1909 Keynes had also published his first professional economics article in *[The Economic Journal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Economic_Journal "The Economic Journal")*, about the effect of a recent global economic downturn on India.<sup id="cite_ref-Minksky_35-0" class="reference"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-Minksky-35"><span class="cite-bracket">[</span>35<span class="cite-bracket">]</span></a></sup> He founded the [Political Economy Club](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_Economy_Club_\(1909\) "Political Economy Club (1909)"), a weekly discussion group. Keynes's earnings rose further as he began to take on pupils for private tuition.

In 1911 Keynes was made the editor of *The Economic Journal*. By 1913 he had published his first book, *Indian Currency and Finance*.<sup id="cite_ref-36" class="reference"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/"><span class="cite-bracket">[</span>36<span class="cite-bracket">]</span></a></sup> He was then appointed to the [Royal Commission](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Commission "Royal Commission") on Indian Currency and Finance<sup id="cite_ref-37" class="reference"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-37"><span class="cite-bracket">[</span>37<span class="cite-bracket">]</span></a></sup> – the same topic as his book – where Keynes showed considerable talent at applying economic theory to practical problems. His written work was published under the name "J M Keynes", though to his family and friends he was known as Maynard. (His father, John Neville Keynes, was also always known by his middle name).<sup id="cite_ref-clarke_38-0" class="reference"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-clarke-38"><span class="cite-bracket">[</span>38<span class="cite-bracket">]</span></a></sup>

### First World War

\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=John_Maynard_Keynes&action=edit&section=3 "Edit section: First World War")\]

The British Government called on Keynes's expertise during the [First World War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_World_War "First World War"). While he did not formally rejoin the civil service in 1914, Keynes travelled to London at the government's request a few days before hostilities started. Bankers had been pushing for the suspension of [specie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hard_money_\(policy\) "Hard money (policy)") payments – the gold equivalent of [banknotes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banknotes "Banknotes") – but with Keynes's help, the [Chancellor of the Exchequer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chancellor_of_the_Exchequer "Chancellor of the Exchequer") (then [Lloyd George](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lloyd_George "Lloyd George")) was persuaded that this would be a bad idea, as it would hurt the future reputation of the city if payments were suspended before it was necessary.

In January 1915 Keynes took up an official government position at the [Treasury](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HM_Treasury "HM Treasury"). Among his responsibilities were the design of terms of credit between Britain and its continental allies during the war and the acquisition of scarce currencies. According to economist [Robert Lekachman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Lekachman "Robert Lekachman"), Keynes's "nerve and mastery became legendary" because of his performance of these duties, as in the case where he managed to assemble a supply of [Spanish pesetas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_peseta "Spanish peseta").

The secretary of the Treasury was delighted to hear Keynes had amassed enough to provide a temporary solution for the British Government. But Keynes did not hand the pesetas over, choosing instead to sell them all to break the market: his boldness paid off, as pesetas then became much less scarce and expensive.<sup id="cite_ref-39" class="reference"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-39"><span class="cite-bracket">[</span>39<span class="cite-bracket">]</span></a></sup>

On the introduction of [military conscription](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_conscription "Military conscription") in 1916, he applied for exemption as a [conscientious objector](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conscientious_objector "Conscientious objector"), which was effectively granted conditional upon continuing his government work.

In the 1917 King's [Birthday Honours](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birthday_Honours "Birthday Honours"), Keynes was appointed Companion of the [Order of the Bath](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_of_the_Bath "Order of the Bath") for his wartime work,<sup id="cite_ref-40" class="reference"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/"><span class="cite-bracket">[</span>40<span class="cite-bracket">]</span></a></sup> and his success led to the appointment that had a huge effect on Keynes's life and career; Keynes was appointed financial representative for the Treasury to the 1919 [Versailles peace conference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris_Peace_Conference_\(1919%E2%80%931920\) "Paris Peace Conference (1919–1920)"). He was also appointed Officer of the Belgian [Order of Leopold](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_of_Leopold_\(Belgium\) "Order of Leopold (Belgium)").<sup id="cite_ref-41" class="reference"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/"><span class="cite-bracket">[</span>41<span class="cite-bracket">]</span></a></sup>

### Versailles peace conference

![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/71/David_Lloyd_George_1902.jpg/250px-David_Lloyd_George_1902.jpg)

Keynes's colleague, [David Lloyd George](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Lloyd_George "David Lloyd George"). Keynes was initially wary of the "Welsh Wizard," preferring his rival [Asquith](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asquith "Asquith"), but was impressed with Lloyd George at Versailles; this did not deter Keynes from painting a scathing picture of the then-prime minister in *[The Economic Consequences of the Peace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Economic_Consequences_of_the_Peace "The Economic Consequences of the Peace")*.

Keynes's experience at [Versailles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_of_Versailles "Treaty of Versailles") was influential in shaping his future outlook, yet it was not a successful one. Keynes's main interest had been in trying to prevent [Germany's compensation payments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_I_reparations "World War I reparations") being set so high it would traumatise innocent German people, damage the nation's ability to pay and sharply limit its ability to buy exports from other countries – thus hurting not just Germany's economy but that of the wider world.

Unfortunately for Keynes, conservative powers in the coalition that emerged from the [1918 coupon election](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1918_United_Kingdom_general_election "1918 United Kingdom general election") were able to ensure that both Keynes himself and the Treasury were largely excluded from formal high-level talks concerning reparations. Their place was taken by the [Heavenly Twins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heavenly_Twins_\(Sumner_and_Cunliffe\) "Heavenly Twins (Sumner and Cunliffe)") – the judge [Lord Sumner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Hamilton,_1st_Viscount_Sumner "John Hamilton, 1st Viscount Sumner") and the banker [Lord Cunliffe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walter_Cunliffe,_1st_Baron_Cunliffe "Walter Cunliffe, 1st Baron Cunliffe"), whose nickname derived from the "astronomically" high war compensation they wanted to demand from Germany. Keynes was forced to try to exert influence mostly from behind the scenes.

The three principal players at the Paris conferences were Britain's Lloyd George, France's [Georges Clemenceau](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georges_Clemenceau "Georges Clemenceau") and America's President [Woodrow Wilson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woodrow_Wilson "Woodrow Wilson").<sup id="cite_ref-origins_42-0" class="reference"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-origins-42"><span class="cite-bracket">[</span>42<span class="cite-bracket">]</span></a></sup> It was only Lloyd George to whom Keynes had much direct access; until the 1918 election he had some sympathy with Keynes's view but while campaigning had found his speeches were well received by the public only if he promised to harshly punish Germany, and had therefore committed his delegation to extracting high payments.

Lloyd George did, however, win some loyalty from Keynes with his actions at the Paris conference by intervening against the French to ensure the dispatch of much-needed food supplies to German civilians. Clemenceau also pushed for substantial reparations, though not as high as those proposed by the British, while on security grounds, France argued for an even more severe settlement than Britain.

Wilson initially favoured relatively lenient treatment of Germany – he feared too harsh conditions could foment the rise of extremism and wanted Germany to be left sufficient capital to pay for imports. To Keynes's dismay, Lloyd George and Clemenceau were able to pressure Wilson to agree to include pensions in the reparations bill.

Towards the end of the conference, Keynes came up with a plan that he argued would not only help Germany and other impoverished central European powers but also be good for the world economy as a whole. It involved the radical writing down of war debts, which would have had the possible effect of increasing international trade all round, but at the same time thrown over two-thirds of the cost of European reconstruction on the United States.<sup id="cite_ref-2003_Skidel_24-3" class="reference"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-2003_Skidel-24"><span class="cite-bracket">[</span>24<span class="cite-bracket">]</span></a></sup><sup class="reference nowrap"><span title="Pages: 225–232">: 225–232 </span></sup> <sup id="cite_ref-44" class="reference"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-44"><span class="cite-bracket">[</span>a<span class="cite-bracket">]</span></a></sup>

Lloyd George agreed it might be acceptable to the British electorate. However, America was against the plan; the US was then the largest creditor, and by this time Wilson had started to believe in the merits of a harsh peace and thought that his country had already made excessive sacrifices. Hence despite his best efforts, the result of the conference was a treaty which disgusted Keynes both on moral and economic grounds and led to his resignation from the Treasury.<sup id="cite_ref-2003_Skidel_24-4" class="reference"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-2003_Skidel-24"><span class="cite-bracket">[</span>24<span class="cite-bracket">]</span></a></sup><sup class="reference nowrap"><span title="Pages: 231–235">: 231–235 </span></sup> 

In June 1919 he turned down an offer to become chairman of the [British Bank of Northern Commerce](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Bank_of_Northern_Commerce "British Bank of Northern Commerce"), a job that promised a salary of £2,000 in return for a morning per week of work.<sup id="cite_ref-2003_Skidel_24-5" class="reference"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-2003_Skidel-24"><span class="cite-bracket">[</span>24<span class="cite-bracket">]</span></a></sup><sup class="reference nowrap"><span title="Page: 234">: 234 </span></sup> 

Keynes's analysis on the predicted damaging effects of the treaty appeared in the highly influential book, *[The Economic Consequences of the Peace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Economic_Consequences_of_the_Peace "The Economic Consequences of the Peace")*, published in 1919.<sup id="cite_ref-45" class="reference"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/"><span class="cite-bracket">[</span>44<span class="cite-bracket">]</span></a></sup> This work has been described as Keynes's best book, where he was able to bring all his gifts to bear – his passion as well as his skill as an economist. In addition to economic analysis, the book contained appeals to the reader's sense of [compassion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compassion "Compassion"):<sup id="cite_ref-ecp_46-0" class="reference"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-ecp-46"><span class="cite-bracket">[</span>45<span class="cite-bracket">]</span></a></sup><sup class="reference nowrap"><span title="Page: 209">: 209 </span></sup> 

> I cannot leave this subject as though its just treatment wholly depended either on our pledges or on economic facts. The policy of reducing Germany to servitude for a generation, of degrading the lives of millions of human beings, and of depriving a whole nation of happiness should be abhorrent and detestable, – abhorrent and detestable, even if it was possible, even if it enriched ourselves, even if it did not sow the decay of the whole civilized life of Europe.

Keynes's followers assert that his predictions of disaster were borne out when the German economy suffered the [hyperinflation of 1923](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperinflation_in_the_Weimar_Republic "Hyperinflation in the Weimar Republic"), and again by the collapse of the [Weimar Republic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weimar_Republic "Weimar Republic") and the outbreak of the Second World War. However, historian [Ruth Henig](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruth_Henig "Ruth Henig") claims that "most historians of the Paris peace conference now take the view that, in economic terms, the treaty was not unduly harsh on Germany and that, while obligations and damages were inevitably much stressed in the debates at Paris to satisfy electors reading the daily newspapers, the intention was quietly to give Germany substantial help towards paying her bills, and to meet many of the German objections by amendments to the way the reparations schedule was in practice carried out".<sup id="cite_ref-47" class="reference"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/"><span class="cite-bracket">[</span>46<span class="cite-bracket">]</span></a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-marks_48-0" class="reference"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-marks-48"><span class="cite-bracket">[</span>47<span class="cite-bracket">]</span></a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-49" class="reference"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/"><span class="cite-bracket">[</span>b<span class="cite-bracket">]</span></a></sup>

Only a small fraction of reparations was ever paid. In fact, historian [Stephen A. Schuker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_A._Schuker "Stephen A. Schuker") demonstrates in *American 'Reparations' to Germany, 1919–33*, that the capital inflow from American loans substantially exceeded German out payments so that, on a net basis, Germany received support equal to four times the amount of the post-Second World War [Marshall Plan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marshall_Plan "Marshall Plan").<sup id="cite_ref-50" class="reference"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/"><span class="cite-bracket">[</span>48<span class="cite-bracket">]</span></a></sup>

Schuker also shows that, in the years after Versailles, Keynes became an informal reparations adviser to the German government, wrote one of the major German reparation notes, and supported hyperinflation on political grounds. Nevertheless, *The Economic Consequences of the Peace* gained Keynes international fame, even though it also caused him to be regarded as anti-establishment – it was not until after the outbreak of the Second World War that Keynes was offered a directorship of a major British Bank, or an acceptable offer to return to government with a formal job. However, Keynes was still able to influence government policy-making through his network of contacts, his published works and by serving on government committees; this included attending high-level policy meetings as a consultant.<sup id="cite_ref-2003_Skidel_24-6" class="reference"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-2003_Skidel-24"><span class="cite-bracket">[</span>24<span class="cite-bracket">]</span></a></sup><sup class="reference nowrap"><span title="Pages: 593–598">: 593–598 </span></sup> 

### In the 1920s

Keynes had completed his *[A Treatise on Probability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Treatise_on_Probability "A Treatise on Probability")* before the war but published it in 1921.<sup id="cite_ref-2003_Skidel_24-7" class="reference"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-2003_Skidel-24"><span class="cite-bracket">[</span>24<span class="cite-bracket">]</span></a></sup><sup class="reference nowrap"><span title="Page: 283">: 283 </span></sup>  The work was a notable contribution to the philosophical and mathematical underpinnings of [probability theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability_theory "Probability theory"), championing the important view that *probabilities* were no more or less than [truth values](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truth_value "Truth value") intermediate between simple truth and falsity. Keynes developed the first upper-lower probabilistic [interval](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interval_\(mathematics\) "Interval (mathematics)") approach to probability in chapters 15 and 17 of this book, as well as having developed the first decision weight approach with his conventional coefficient of risk and weight, *c*, in chapter 26. In addition to his academic work, the 1920s saw Keynes active as a journalist selling his work internationally and working in London as a financial consultant. In 1924 Keynes wrote an obituary for his former tutor [Alfred Marshall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfred_Marshall "Alfred Marshall") which [Joseph Schumpeter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Schumpeter "Joseph Schumpeter") called "the most brilliant life of a man of science I have ever read".<sup id="cite_ref-51" class="reference"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/"><span class="cite-bracket">[</span>49<span class="cite-bracket">]</span></a></sup> [Mary Paley Marshall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary_Paley_Marshall "Mary Paley Marshall") was "entranced" by the memorial, while [Lytton Strachey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lytton_Strachey "Lytton Strachey") rated it as one of Keynes's "best works".<sup id="cite_ref-2003_Skidel_24-8" class="reference"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-2003_Skidel-24"><span class="cite-bracket">[</span>24<span class="cite-bracket">]</span></a></sup><sup class="reference nowrap"><span title="Page: 342">: 342 </span></sup> 

In 1922 Keynes continued to advocate reduction of German reparations with *A Revision of the Treaty*.<sup id="cite_ref-2003_Skidel_24-9" class="reference"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-2003_Skidel-24"><span class="cite-bracket">[</span>24<span class="cite-bracket">]</span></a></sup><sup class="reference nowrap"><span title="Page: 245">: 245 </span></sup>  He attacked the post-World War I deflation policies with *[A Tract on Monetary Reform](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Tract_on_Monetary_Reform "A Tract on Monetary Reform")* in 1923<sup id="cite_ref-2003_Skidel_24-10" class="reference"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-2003_Skidel-24"><span class="cite-bracket">[</span>24<span class="cite-bracket">]</span></a></sup><sup class="reference nowrap"><span title="Page: 329">: 329 </span></sup>  – a trenchant argument that countries should target stability of domestic prices, avoiding deflation even at the cost of allowing their currency to depreciate. Britain suffered from high unemployment through most of the 1920s, leading Keynes to recommend the depreciation of [sterling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pound_sterling "Pound sterling") to boost jobs by making British exports more affordable. From 1924 he was also advocating a fiscal response, where the government could create jobs by spending on public works.<sup id="cite_ref-2003_Skidel_24-11" class="reference"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-2003_Skidel-24"><span class="cite-bracket">[</span>24<span class="cite-bracket">]</span></a></sup><sup class="reference nowrap"><span title="Pages: 343–344">: 343–344 </span></sup>  During the 1920s Keynes's pro-stimulus views had only limited effect on policymakers and mainstream academic opinion – according to [Hyman Minsky](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyman_Minsky "Hyman Minsky") one reason was that at this time his theoretical justification was "muddled".<sup id="cite_ref-Minksky_35-1" class="reference"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-Minksky-35"><span class="cite-bracket">[</span>35<span class="cite-bracket">]</span></a></sup> The *Tract* had also called for an end to the gold standard. Keynes advised it was no longer a net benefit for countries such as Britain to participate in the [gold standard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_standard "Gold standard"), as it ran counter to the need for domestic policy autonomy. It could force countries to pursue deflationary policies at exactly the time when expansionary measures were called for to address rising unemployment. The Treasury and Bank of England were still in favour of the gold standard and in 1925 they were able to convince the then Chancellor [Winston Churchill](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winston_Churchill "Winston Churchill") to re-establish it, which had a depressing effect on British industry. Keynes responded by writing *The Economic Consequences of Mr. Churchill* and continued to argue against the gold standard until Britain finally abandoned it in 1931.<sup id="cite_ref-2003_Skidel_24-12" class="reference"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-2003_Skidel-24"><span class="cite-bracket">[</span>24<span class="cite-bracket">]</span></a></sup><sup class="reference nowrap"><span title="Pages: 352–355">: 352–355 </span></sup> 

### During the Great Depression

\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=John_Maynard_Keynes&action=edit&section=6 "Edit section: During the Great Depression")\]

The [Great Depression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Depression "Great Depression") and its periods of worldwide economic hardship formed the backdrop against which the [Keynesian Revolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keynesian_Revolution "Keynesian Revolution") took place. This image is *[Migrant Mother](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Migrant_Mother "Migrant Mother")*, taken by photographer [Dorothea Lange](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dorothea_Lange "Dorothea Lange") in March 1936.

Keynes had begun a theoretical work to examine the relationship between unemployment, money and prices back in the 1920s.<sup id="cite_ref-50_greats_52-0" class="reference"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-50_greats-52"><span class="cite-bracket">[</span>50<span class="cite-bracket">]</span></a></sup> The work, *[Treatise on Money](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Treatise_on_Money "A Treatise on Money")*, was published in 1930 in two volumes. A central idea of the work was that if the amount of money being saved exceeds the amount being invested – which can happen if interest rates are too high – then unemployment will rise. This is in part a result of people not wanting to spend too high a proportion of what employers pay out, making it difficult, in aggregate, for employers to make a profit. Another key theme of the book is the unreliability of financial [indices](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Index_\(economics\) "Index (economics)") for representing an accurate – or indeed meaningful – indication of general shifts in purchasing power of currencies over time. In particular, he criticised the justification of Britain's return to the [gold standard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_standard "Gold standard") in 1925 at pre-war valuation by reference to the [wholesale price index](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wholesale_price_index "Wholesale price index"). He argued that the index understated the effects of changes in the costs of services and labour.

Keynes was deeply critical of the British government's austerity measures during the [Great Depression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Depression "Great Depression"). He believed that budget deficits during [recessions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recession "Recession") were a good thing and a natural product of an economic slump. He wrote, "For Government borrowing of one kind or another is nature's remedy, so to speak, for preventing business losses from being, in so severe a slump as the present one, so great as to bring production altogether to a standstill."<sup id="cite_ref-Cassidy2011_53-0" class="reference"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-Cassidy2011-53"><span class="cite-bracket">[</span>51<span class="cite-bracket">]</span></a></sup>

At the height of the Great Depression, in 1933, Keynes published *The Means to Prosperity*, which contained specific policy recommendations for tackling unemployment in a global recession, chiefly counter-cyclical public spending. *The Means to Prosperity* contains one of the first mentions of the [multiplier effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiplier_\(economics\) "Multiplier (economics)"). While it was addressed chiefly to the British Government, it also contained advice for other nations affected by the global recession. A copy was sent to the newly elected President [Franklin D. Roosevelt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franklin_D._Roosevelt "Franklin D. Roosevelt") and other world leaders. The work was taken seriously by both the American and British governments, and according to [Robert Skidelsky](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Skidelsky "Robert Skidelsky"), helped pave the way for the later acceptance of Keynesian ideas, though it had little immediate practical influence. In the 1933 [London Economic Conference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London_Economic_Conference "London Economic Conference") opinions remained too diverse for a unified course of action to be agreed upon.<sup id="cite_ref-2003_Skidel_24-13" class="reference"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-2003_Skidel-24"><span class="cite-bracket">[</span>24<span class="cite-bracket">]</span></a></sup><sup class="reference nowrap"><span title="Pages: 490–500">: 490–500 </span></sup>

Keynesian-like policies were adopted by Sweden and Germany, but Sweden was seen as too small to command much attention, and Keynes was deliberately silent about the [successful efforts of Germany](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_Nazi_Germany#Pre-war:_1933%E2%80%931939 "Economy of Nazi Germany") as he was dismayed by its imperialist ambitions and its treatment of Jews.<sup id="cite_ref-2003_Skidel_24-14" class="reference"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-2003_Skidel-24"><span class="cite-bracket">[</span>24<span class="cite-bracket">]</span></a></sup><sup class="reference nowrap"><span title="Pages: 500–504">: 500–504 </span></sup>  Apart from Great Britain, Keynes's attention was primarily focused on the United States. In 1931, he received considerable support for his views on counter-cyclical public spending in Chicago, then America's foremost center for economic views alternative to the mainstream.<sup id="cite_ref-Minksky_35-2" class="reference"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-Minksky-35"><span class="cite-bracket">[</span>35<span class="cite-bracket">]</span></a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-2003_Skidel_24-15" class="reference"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-2003_Skidel-24"><span class="cite-bracket">[</span>24<span class="cite-bracket">]</span></a></sup><sup class="reference nowrap"><span title="Page: 507">: 507 </span></sup>  However, orthodox economic opinion remained generally hostile regarding fiscal intervention to mitigate the [depression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_depression "Economic depression"), until just before the [outbreak of war](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II "World War II").<sup id="cite_ref-Minksky_35-3" class="reference"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-Minksky-35"><span class="cite-bracket">[</span>35<span class="cite-bracket">]</span></a></sup> In late 1933 Keynes was persuaded by [Felix Frankfurter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Felix_Frankfurter "Felix Frankfurter") to address President Roosevelt directly, which he did by letters and face-to-face in 1934, after which the two men spoke highly of each other.<sup id="cite_ref-2003_Skidel_24-16" class="reference"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-2003_Skidel-24"><span class="cite-bracket">[</span>24<span class="cite-bracket">]</span></a></sup><sup class="reference nowrap"><span title="Pages: 506–509">: 506–509 </span></sup>  However, according to Skidelsky, the consensus is that Keynes's efforts began to have a more than marginal influence on US economic policy only after 1939.<sup id="cite_ref-2003_Skidel_24-17" class="reference"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-2003_Skidel-24"><span class="cite-bracket">[</span>24<span class="cite-bracket">]</span></a></sup>

Keynes's *[magnum opus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnum_opus "Magnum opus")*, *[The General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_General_Theory_of_Employment,_Interest_and_Money "The General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money")* was published in 1936.<sup id="cite_ref-gen_theory_13-1" class="reference"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-gen_theory-13"><span class="cite-bracket">[</span>13<span class="cite-bracket">]</span></a></sup>It was researched and indexed by one of Keynes's favourite students, and later economist, [David Bensusan-Butt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Bensusan-Butt "David Bensusan-Butt").<sup id="cite_ref-54" class="reference"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/"><span class="cite-bracket">[</span>52<span class="cite-bracket">]</span></a></sup> The work served as a theoretical justification for the [interventionist policies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_interventionism "Economic interventionism") Keynes favoured for tackling a recession. Although Keynes stated in his preface that his General Theory was only secondarily concerned with the "applications of this theory to practice", the circumstances of its publication were such that his suggestions shaped the course of the 1930s.<sup id="cite_ref-55" class="reference"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/"><span class="cite-bracket">[</span>53<span class="cite-bracket">]</span></a></sup> In addition, Keynes introduced the world to a new interpretation of taxation: since the legal tender is now defined by the state, inflation becomes "taxation by currency depreciation". This hidden tax meant a) that the standard of value should be governed by deliberate decision; and (b) that it was possible to maintain a middle course between deflation and inflation.<sup id="cite_ref-56" class="reference"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/"><span class="cite-bracket">[</span>54<span class="cite-bracket">]</span></a></sup> This novel interpretation was inspired by the desperate search for control over the economy which permeated the academic world after the Depression. The *General Theory* challenged the earlier [neoclassical economic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neoclassical_economics "Neoclassical economics") paradigm, which had held that provided it was unfettered by government interference, the market would naturally establish [full employment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full_employment "Full employment") equilibrium. In doing so Keynes was partly setting himself against his former teachers Marshall and Pigou. Keynes believed the classical theory was a "special case" that applied only to the particular conditions present in the 19th century, his theory being the general one. Classical economists had believed in [Say's law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Say%27s_law "Say's law"), which, simply put, states that "[supply creates its demand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supply_creates_its_demand "Supply creates its demand")", and that in a free-market workers would always be willing to lower their wages to a level where employers could profitably offer them jobs.<sup id="cite_ref-kishtainy_57-0" class="reference"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-kishtainy-57"><span class="cite-bracket">[</span>55<span class="cite-bracket">]</span></a></sup>

An innovation from Keynes was the concept of [price stickiness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nominal_rigidity "Nominal rigidity") – the recognition that in reality workers often refuse to lower their wage demands even in cases where a classical economist might argue that it is rational for them to do so. Due in part to price stickiness, it was established that the interaction of "[aggregate demand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aggregate_demand "Aggregate demand")" and "[aggregate supply](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aggregate_supply "Aggregate supply")" may lead to stable unemployment equilibria – and in those cases, it is on the state, not the market, that economies must depend for their salvation. In contrast, Keynes argued that demand is what creates supply and not the other way around. He questioned Say's Law by asking what would happen if the money that is being given to individuals is not finding its way back into the economy and is saved instead. He suggested the result would be a recession. To tackle the fear of a recession Say's Law suggests government intervention. This government intervention can be used to prevent any further increase in savings in the form of a decreased interest rate. Decreasing the interest rate will encourage people to start spending and investing again, or so it is stated by Say's Law. The reason behind this is that when there is little investing, savings start to accumulate and reach a stopping point in the flow of money. During the normal economic activity, it would be justified to have savings because they can be given out as loans but in this case, there is little demand for them, so they are doing no good for the economy. The supply of savings then exceeds the demand for loans and the result is lower prices or lower interest rates. Thus, the idea is that the money that was once saved is now re-invested or spent, assuming lower interest rates appeal to consumers. To Keynes, however, this was not always the case, and it couldn't be assumed that lower interest rates would automatically encourage investment and spending again since there is no proven link between the two.<sup id="cite_ref-kishtainy_57-1" class="reference"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-kishtainy-57"><span class="cite-bracket">[</span>55<span class="cite-bracket">]</span></a></sup>

The *General Theory* argues that demand, not supply, is the key variable governing the overall level of economic activity. Aggregate demand, which equals total un-hoarded income in a society, is defined by the sum of consumption and investment. In a state of unemployment and unused production capacity, one can enhance employment and total income *only* by *first* increasing expenditures for either consumption or investment. Without government intervention to increase expenditure, an economy can remain trapped in a low-employment equilibrium. The demonstration of this possibility has been described as the revolutionary formal achievement of the work.<sup id="cite_ref-2003_Skidel_24-18" class="reference"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-2003_Skidel-24"><span class="cite-bracket">[</span>24<span class="cite-bracket">]</span></a></sup><sup class="reference nowrap"><span title="Pages: 528–538">: 528–538 </span></sup>  The book advocated activist economic policy by government to stimulate demand in times of high unemployment, for example by spending on [public works](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_works "Public works"). "Let us be up and doing, using our idle resources to increase our wealth," he wrote in 1928. "With men and plants unemployed, it is ridiculous to say that we cannot afford these new developments. It is precisely with these plants and these men that we shall afford them."<sup id="cite_ref-Cassidy2011_53-1" class="reference"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-Cassidy2011-53"><span class="cite-bracket">[</span>51<span class="cite-bracket">]</span></a></sup>

The *General Theory* is often viewed as the foundation of modern [macroeconomics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macroeconomics "Macroeconomics"). Few senior American economists agreed with Keynes through most of the 1930s.<sup id="cite_ref-Hazlit_58-0" class="reference"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-Hazlit-58"><span class="cite-bracket">[</span>56<span class="cite-bracket">]</span></a></sup> Yet his ideas were soon to achieve widespread acceptance, with eminent American professors such as [Alvin Hansen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alvin_Hansen "Alvin Hansen") agreeing with the *General Theory* before the outbreak of World War II.<sup id="cite_ref-new_economics_59-0" class="reference"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-new_economics-59"><span class="cite-bracket">[</span>57<span class="cite-bracket">]</span></a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-60" class="reference"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-60"><span class="cite-bracket">[</span>58<span class="cite-bracket">]</span></a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-K_rev._and_critics_61-0" class="reference"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-K_rev._and_critics-61"><span class="cite-bracket">[</span>59<span class="cite-bracket">]</span></a></sup>

Keynes himself had only limited participation in the theoretical debates that followed the publication of the *General Theory* as he suffered a heart attack in 1937, requiring him to take long periods of rest. Among others, [Hyman Minsky](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyman_Minsky "Hyman Minsky") and [Post-Keynesian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post-Keynesian_economics "Post-Keynesian economics") economists have argued that as a result, Keynes's ideas were diluted by those keen to compromise with classical economists or to render his concepts with mathematical models like the [IS–LM model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IS%E2%80%93LM_model "IS–LM model") (which, they argue, distort Keynes's ideas).<sup id="cite_ref-Minksky_35-4" class="reference"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-Minksky-35"><span class="cite-bracket">[</span>35<span class="cite-bracket">]</span></a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-K_rev._and_critics_61-1" class="reference"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-K_rev._and_critics-61"><span class="cite-bracket">[</span>59<span class="cite-bracket">]</span></a></sup> Keynes began to recover in 1939, but for the rest of his life his professional energies were directed largely towards the practical side of economics: the problems of ensuring optimum allocation of resources for the war efforts, post-war negotiations with America, and the new international financial order that was presented at the [Bretton Woods Conference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bretton_Woods_Conference "Bretton Woods Conference").

In the *General Theory* and later, Keynes responded to the socialists who argued, especially during the Great Depression of the 1930s, that capitalism caused war. He argued that if capitalism were managed domestically and internationally (with coordinated international Keynesian policies, an international monetary system that did not pit the interests of countries against one another, and a high degree of freedom of trade), then this system of managed capitalism could promote peace rather than conflict between countries. His plans during World War II for post-war international economic institutions and policies (which contributed to the creation at Bretton Woods of the [International Monetary Fund](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Monetary_Fund "International Monetary Fund") and the [World Bank](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Bank "World Bank"), and later to the creation of the [General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Agreement_on_Tariffs_and_Trade "General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade") and eventually the [World Trade Organization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Trade_Organization "World Trade Organization")) were aimed to give effect to this vision.<sup id="cite_ref-62" class="reference"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-62"><span class="cite-bracket">[</span>60<span class="cite-bracket">]</span></a></sup>

Although Keynes has been widely criticised – especially by members of the [Chicago school of economics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_school_of_economics "Chicago school of economics") – for advocating irresponsible government spending financed by borrowing, in fact he was a firm believer in balanced budgets and regarded the proposals for programmes of public works during the Great Depression as an exceptional measure to meet the needs of exceptional circumstances.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEDavenport-Hines2015[[Category:Wikipedia_articles_needing_page_number_citations_from_January_2025]]<sup_class=&quot;noprint_Inline-Template_&quot;_style=&quot;white-space:nowrap;&quot;>&amp;#91;<i>[[Wikipedia:Citing_sources|<span_title=&quot;This_citation_requires_a_reference_to_the_specific_page_or_range_of_pages_in_which_the_material_appears.&amp;#32;(January_2025)&quot;>page&amp;nbsp;needed</span>]]</i>&amp;#93;</sup>_63-0" class="reference"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-FOOTNOTEDavenport-Hines2015[[Category:Wikipedia_articles_needing_page_number_citations_from_January_2025]]%3Csup_class=%22noprint_Inline-Template_%22_style=%22white-space:nowrap;%22%3E&amp;#91;%3Ci%3E[[Wikipedia:Citing_sources|%3Cspan_title=%22This_citation_requires_a_reference_to_the_specific_page_or_range_of_pages_in_which_the_material_appears.&amp;#32;(January_2025)%22%3Epage&amp;nbsp;needed%3C/span%3E]]%3C/i%3E&amp;#93;%3C/sup%3E-63"><span class="cite-bracket">[</span>61<span class="cite-bracket">]</span></a></sup>

### Second World War

\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=John_Maynard_Keynes&action=edit&section=7 "Edit section: Second World War")\]

Keynes (right) and the US representative [Harry Dexter White](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Dexter_White "Harry Dexter White") at the inaugural meeting of the [International Monetary Fund](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Monetary_Fund "International Monetary Fund")'s Board of Governors in [Savannah, Georgia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Savannah,_Georgia "Savannah, Georgia") in 1946

During the [Second World War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_World_War "Second World War"), Keynes argued in *[How to Pay for the War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/How_to_Pay_for_the_War "How to Pay for the War")*, published in 1940, that the war effort should be largely financed by higher taxation and especially by compulsory saving (essentially workers lending money to the government), rather than [deficit spending](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deficit_spending "Deficit spending"), to avoid inflation. Compulsory saving would act to dampen domestic demand, assist in channelling additional output towards the war efforts, would be fairer than punitive taxation and would have the advantage of helping to avoid a post-war slump by boosting demand once workers were allowed to withdraw their savings. In September 1941 he was proposed to fill a vacancy in the Court of Directors of the [Bank of England](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_of_England "Bank of England"), and subsequently carried out a full term from the following April.<sup id="cite_ref-64" class="reference"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-64"><span class="cite-bracket">[</span>62<span class="cite-bracket">]</span></a></sup> In June 1942, Keynes was rewarded for his service with a [hereditary peerage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hereditary_peer "Hereditary peer") in the King's Birthday Honours.<sup id="cite_ref-TheLondon_65-0" class="reference"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-TheLondon-65"><span class="cite-bracket">[</span>63<span class="cite-bracket">]</span></a></sup> On 7 July his title was [gazetted](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_London_Gazette "The London Gazette") as "**Baron Keynes**, of Tilton, in the County of [Sussex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sussex "Sussex")" and he took his seat in the [House of Lords](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_of_Lords "House of Lords") on the [Liberal Party](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberal_Party_\(UK\) "Liberal Party (UK)") benches.<sup id="cite_ref-66" class="reference"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-66"><span class="cite-bracket">[</span>64<span class="cite-bracket">]</span></a></sup>

As the [Allied](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allies_of_World_War_II "Allies of World War II") victory began to look certain, Keynes was heavily involved, as leader of the British delegation and chairman of the [World Bank](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Bank "World Bank") commission, in the mid-1944 negotiations that established the [Bretton Woods system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bretton_Woods_system "Bretton Woods system"). The Keynes plan, concerning an international clearing-union, argued for a radical system for the management of currencies. He proposed the creation of a common world unit of currency, the [bancor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bancor "Bancor") and new global institutions – a world [central bank](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_bank "Central bank") and the [International Clearing Union](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Clearing_Union "International Clearing Union"). Keynes envisaged these institutions as managing an international trade and payments system with strong incentives for countries to avoid substantial trade deficits or surpluses.<sup id="cite_ref-67" class="reference"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-67"><span class="cite-bracket">[</span>65<span class="cite-bracket">]</span></a></sup> The USA's greater negotiating strength, however, meant that the outcomes accorded more closely to the more conservative plans of [Harry Dexter White](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Dexter_White "Harry Dexter White"). According to US economist [J. Bradford DeLong](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._Bradford_DeLong "J. Bradford DeLong"), on almost every point where he was overruled by the Americans, Keynes was later proven correct by events.<sup id="cite_ref-68" class="reference"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-68"><span class="cite-bracket">[</span>66<span class="cite-bracket">]</span></a></sup>

The two new institutions, later known as the World Bank and the [International Monetary Fund](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Monetary_Fund "International Monetary Fund") (IMF), were founded as a compromise that primarily reflected the American vision. There would be no incentives for states to avoid a large [trade surplus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balance_of_trade "Balance of trade"); instead, the burden for correcting a trade imbalance would continue to fall only on the [deficit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deficit_spending "Deficit spending") countries, which Keynes had argued were least able to address the problem without inflicting economic hardship on their populations. Yet, Keynes was still pleased when accepting the final agreement, saying that if the institutions stayed true to their founding principles, "the brotherhood of man will have become more than a phrase."<sup id="cite_ref-69" class="reference"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-69"><span class="cite-bracket">[</span>67<span class="cite-bracket">]</span></a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-70" class="reference"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-70"><span class="cite-bracket">[</span>68<span class="cite-bracket">]</span></a></sup>

### Postwar

\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=John_Maynard_Keynes&action=edit&section=8 "Edit section: Postwar")\]

After the war, Keynes continued to represent the United Kingdom in international negotiations despite his deteriorating health. He succeeded in obtaining preferential terms from the United States [for new and outstanding debts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anglo-American_loan "Anglo-American loan") to facilitate the rebuilding of the British economy.<sup id="cite_ref-timeline_71-0" class="reference"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-timeline-71"><span class="cite-bracket">[</span>69<span class="cite-bracket">]</span></a></sup><sup class="reference nowrap"><span title="Location: §1945 to 1946">: <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://www.maynardkeynes.org/keynes-career-timeline.html#intfin">§1945 to 1946</a> </span></sup> 

Just before his death in 1946, Keynes told Henry Clay, a professor of social economics and advisor to the [Bank of England](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_of_England "Bank of England"),<sup id="cite_ref-72" class="reference"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-72"><span class="cite-bracket">[</span>70<span class="cite-bracket">]</span></a></sup> of his hopes that [Adam Smith](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_Smith "Adam Smith")'s "[invisible hand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invisible_hand "Invisible hand")" could help Britain out of the economic hole it was in: "I find myself more and more relying for a solution of our problems on the invisible hand which I tried to eject from economic thinking twenty years ago."<sup id="cite_ref-timeline_71-1" class="reference"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-timeline-71"><span class="cite-bracket">[</span>69<span class="cite-bracket">]</span></a></sup><sup class="reference nowrap"><span title="Location: §1945 to 1946">: <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://www.maynardkeynes.org/keynes-career-timeline.html#intfin">§1945 to 1946</a> </span></sup>

### Views on free trade and protectionism

\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=John_Maynard_Keynes&action=edit&section=10 "Edit section: Views on free trade and protectionism")\]

#### Turning point of the Great Depression

\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=John_Maynard_Keynes&action=edit&section=11 "Edit section: Turning point of the Great Depression")\]

According to Keynesian theory, trade deficits are harmful.The countries that import more than they export weaken their economies. When the trade deficit increases, unemployment rises and [gross domestic product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gross_domestic_product "Gross domestic product") (GDP) slows down. Furthermore, surplus countries exert a "negative externality" on their trading partners. They get richer at the expense of others and destroy the output of their trading partners. John Maynard Keynes believed that the products of surplus countries should be taxed to avoid trade imbalances.<sup id="cite_ref-stig_73-0" class="reference"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-stig-73"><span class="cite-bracket">[</span>71<span class="cite-bracket">]</span></a></sup>

At the beginning of his career, Keynes was an economist close to [Alfred Marshall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfred_Marshall "Alfred Marshall"), deeply convinced of the benefits of free trade. From the crisis of 1929 onwards, noting the commitment of the British authorities to defend the gold parity of the pound sterling and the rigidity of nominal wages, he gradually adhered to protectionist measures.<sup id="cite_ref-Maurin_free_14-1" class="reference"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-Maurin_free-14"><span class="cite-bracket">[</span>14<span class="cite-bracket">]</span></a></sup>

On 5 November 1929, when heard by the [Macmillan Committee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macmillan_Committee "Macmillan Committee") to bring the British economy out of the crisis, Keynes indicated that the introduction of tariffs on imports would help to rebalance the trade balance. The committee's report states in a section entitled "import control and export aid", that in an economy where there is not full employment, the introduction of tariffs can improve production and employment. Thus, the reduction of the trade deficit favours the country's growth.<sup id="cite_ref-Maurin_free_14-2" class="reference"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-Maurin_free-14"><span class="cite-bracket">[</span>14<span class="cite-bracket">]</span></a></sup>

In January 1930, in the Economic Advisory Council, Keynes proposed the introduction of a system of protection to reduce imports. In the autumn of 1930, he proposed a uniform tariff of 10% on all imports and subsidies of the same rate for all exports.<sup id="cite_ref-Maurin_free_14-3" class="reference"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-Maurin_free-14"><span class="cite-bracket">[</span>14<span class="cite-bracket">]</span></a></sup> In the *Treatise on Money*, published in the autumn of 1930, he took up the idea of tariffs or other trade restrictions with the aim of reducing the volume of imports and rebalancing the balance of trade.<sup id="cite_ref-Maurin_free_14-4" class="reference"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-Maurin_free-14"><span class="cite-bracket">[</span>14<span class="cite-bracket">]</span></a></sup>

On 7 March 1931, in the *[New Statesman and Nation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Statesman_and_Nation "New Statesman and Nation")*, he wrote an article entitled *Proposal for a Tariff Revenue*. He pointed out that the reduction in wages led to a reduction in national demand which constrained markets. Instead, he proposed the idea of an expansionary policy combined with a tariff system to neutralise the effects on the balance of trade. The application of customs tariffs seemed to him "unavoidable, whoever the Chancellor of the Exchequer might be". Thus, for Keynes, an economic recovery policy is only fully effective if the trade deficit is eliminated. He proposed a 15% tax on manufactured and semi-manufactured goods and 5% on certain foodstuffs and raw materials, with others needed for exports exempted (wool, cotton).<sup id="cite_ref-Maurin_free_14-5" class="reference"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-Maurin_free-14"><span class="cite-bracket">[</span>14<span class="cite-bracket">]</span></a></sup>

In 1932, in an article entitled *The Pro- and Anti-Tariffs*, published in *[The Listener](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Listener_\(magazine\) "The Listener (magazine)")*, he envisaged the protection of farmers and certain sectors such as the automobile and iron and steel industries, considering them indispensable to Britain.<sup id="cite_ref-Maurin_free_14-6" class="reference"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-Maurin_free-14"><span class="cite-bracket">[</span>14<span class="cite-bracket">]</span></a></sup>

#### Critique of the theory of comparative advantage

\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=John_Maynard_Keynes&action=edit&section=12 "Edit section: Critique of the theory of comparative advantage")\]

In the post-crisis situation of 1929, Keynes judged the assumptions of the free trade model unrealistic. He criticised, for example, the neoclassical assumption of wage adjustment.<sup id="cite_ref-Maurin_free_14-7" class="reference"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-Maurin_free-14"><span class="cite-bracket">[</span>14<span class="cite-bracket">]</span></a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-Maurin_thesis_15-1" class="reference"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-Maurin_thesis-15"><span class="cite-bracket">[</span>15<span class="cite-bracket">]</span></a></sup>

As early as 1930, in a note to the Economic Advisory Council, he doubted the intensity of the gain from specialisation in the case of manufactured goods. While participating in the MacMillan Committee, he admitted that he no longer "believed in a very high degree of national specialisation" and refused to "abandon any industry which is unable, for the moment, to survive". He also criticised the static dimension of the theory of comparative advantage, which, in his view, by fixing comparative advantages definitively, led in practice to a waste of national resources.<sup id="cite_ref-Maurin_free_14-8" class="reference"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-Maurin_free-14"><span class="cite-bracket">[</span>14<span class="cite-bracket">]</span></a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-Maurin_thesis_15-2" class="reference"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-Maurin_thesis-15"><span class="cite-bracket">[</span>15<span class="cite-bracket">]</span></a></sup>

In the *[Daily Mail](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daily_Mail "Daily Mail")* of 13 March 1931, he called the assumption of perfect sectoral labour mobility "nonsense" since it states that a person made unemployed contributes to a reduction in the wage rate until he finds a job. But for Keynes, this change of job may involve costs (job search, training) and is not always possible. Generally speaking, for Keynes, the assumptions of full employment and automatic return to equilibrium discredit the theory of comparative advantage.<sup id="cite_ref-Maurin_free_14-9" class="reference"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-Maurin_free-14"><span class="cite-bracket">[</span>14<span class="cite-bracket">]</span></a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-Maurin_thesis_15-3" class="reference"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-Maurin_thesis-15"><span class="cite-bracket">[</span>15<span class="cite-bracket">]</span></a></sup>

In July 1933, he published an article in the *New Statesman and Nation* entitled *National Self-Sufficiency*, in which he criticised the argument of the specialisation of economies, which is the basis of free trade. He thus proposed the search for a certain degree of self-sufficiency. Instead of the specialisation of economies advocated by the Ricardian theory of comparative advantage, he prefers the maintenance of a diversity of activities for nations.<sup id="cite_ref-Maurin_thesis_15-4" class="reference"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-Maurin_thesis-15"><span class="cite-bracket">[</span>15<span class="cite-bracket">]</span></a></sup> In it he refutes the principle of peacemaking trade. His vision of trade became that of a system where foreign capitalists compete for new markets. He defends the idea of producing on national soil when possible and reasonable and expresses sympathy for the advocates of [protectionism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protectionism "Protectionism").<sup id="cite_ref-National_Self-Sufficiency_16-1" class="reference"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-National_Self-Sufficiency-16"><span class="cite-bracket">[</span>16<span class="cite-bracket">]</span></a></sup> He notes in *National Self-Sufficiency*:<sup id="cite_ref-National_Self-Sufficiency_16-2" class="reference"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-National_Self-Sufficiency-16"><span class="cite-bracket">[</span>16<span class="cite-bracket">]</span></a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-Maurin_free_14-10" class="reference"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-Maurin_free-14"><span class="cite-bracket">[</span>14<span class="cite-bracket">]</span></a></sup>

> A considerable degree of international specialization is necessary in a rational world in all cases where it is dictated by wide differences of climate, natural resources, native aptitudes, level of culture and density of population. But over an increasingly wide range of industrial products, and perhaps of agricultural products also, I have become doubtful whether the economic loss of national self-sufficiency is great enough to outweigh the other advantages of gradually bringing the product and the consumer within the ambit of the same national, economic, and financial organization. Experience accumulates to prove that most modern processes of mass production can be performed in most countries and climates with almost equal efficiency.

He also writes in *National Self-Sufficiency*:<sup id="cite_ref-National_Self-Sufficiency_16-3" class="reference"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-National_Self-Sufficiency-16"><span class="cite-bracket">[</span>16<span class="cite-bracket">]</span></a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-Maurin_free_14-11" class="reference"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-Maurin_free-14"><span class="cite-bracket">[</span>14<span class="cite-bracket">]</span></a></sup>

> I sympathize, therefore, with those who would minimize, rather than with those who would maximize, economic entanglement among nations. Ideas, knowledge, science, hospitality, travel – these are the things which should of their nature be international. But let goods be homespun whenever it is reasonably and conveniently possible, and, above all, let finance be primarily national.

Later, Keynes had a written correspondence with [James Meade](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Meade "James Meade") centred on the issue of import restrictions. Keynes and Meade discussed the best choice between quota and tariff. In March 1944 Keynes began a discussion with [Marcus Fleming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcus_Fleming "Marcus Fleming") after the latter had written an article entitled *Quotas versus depreciation*. On this occasion, we see that he has definitely taken a protectionist stance after the [Great Depression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Depression "Great Depression"). He considered that quotas could be more effective than currency depreciation in dealing with external imbalances. Thus, for Keynes, currency depreciation was no longer sufficient and protectionist measures became necessary to avoid trade deficits. To avoid the return of crises due to a self-regulating economic system, it seemed essential to him to regulate trade and stop free trade (deregulation of foreign trade).<sup id="cite_ref-Maurin_free_14-12" class="reference"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-Maurin_free-14"><span class="cite-bracket">[</span>14<span class="cite-bracket">]</span></a></sup>

### Views on trade imbalances

\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=John_Maynard_Keynes&action=edit&section=13 "Edit section: Views on trade imbalances")\]

Keynes was the principal author of a proposal – the so-called Keynes Plan – for an [International Clearing Union](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Clearing_Union "International Clearing Union"). The two governing principles of the plan were that the problem of settling outstanding balances should be solved by "creating" additional "international money", and that debtor and creditor should be treated almost alike as disturbers of equilibrium. In the event, though, the plans were rejected, in part because "American opinion was naturally reluctant to accept the principle of equality of treatment so novel in debtor-creditor relationships".<sup id="cite_ref-outline_74-0" class="reference"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-outline-74"><span class="cite-bracket">[</span>72<span class="cite-bracket">]</span></a></sup><sup class="reference nowrap"><span title="Pages: 326–329">: <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://archive.org/details/dli.ernet.16802/page/327/mode/2up">326–329</a> </span></sup> 

The new system is not founded on free-trade (liberalisation<sup id="cite_ref-inve_Dere_75-0" class="reference"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-inve_Dere-75"><span class="cite-bracket">[</span>73<span class="cite-bracket">]</span></a></sup> of foreign trade<sup id="cite_ref-inve_Trad_76-0" class="reference"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-inve_Trad-76"><span class="cite-bracket">[</span>74<span class="cite-bracket">]</span></a></sup>) but rather on the regulation of international trade, to eliminate trade imbalances: the nations with a surplus would have an incentive to reduce it, and in doing so they would automatically clear other nations deficits.<sup id="cite_ref-scho_77-0" class="reference"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-scho_-77"><span class="cite-bracket">[</span>75<span class="cite-bracket">]</span></a></sup> He proposed a global bank that would issue its currency – the bancor – which was exchangeable with national currencies at fixed rates of exchange and would become the unit of account between nations, which means it would be used to measure a country's trade deficit or trade surplus. Every country would have an overdraft facility in its bancor account at the International Clearing Union. He pointed out that surpluses lead to weak global aggregate demand – countries running surpluses exert a "negative externality" on trading partners, and pose, far more than those in deficit, a threat to global prosperity.<sup id="cite_ref-stig_73-1" class="reference"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-stig-73"><span class="cite-bracket">[</span>71<span class="cite-bracket">]</span></a></sup>

In his 1933 *[Yale Review](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yale_Review "Yale Review")* article "National Self-Sufficiency",<sup id="cite_ref-National_Self-Sufficiency_16-4" class="reference"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-National_Self-Sufficiency-16"><span class="cite-bracket">[</span>16<span class="cite-bracket">]</span></a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-78" class="reference"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-78"><span class="cite-bracket">[</span>76<span class="cite-bracket">]</span></a></sup> he already highlighted the problems created by free trade. His view, supported by many economists and commentators at the time, was that creditor nations may be just as responsible as debtor nations for disequilibrium in exchanges and that both should be under an obligation to bring trade back into a state of balance. Failure for them to do so could have serious consequences. In the words of [Geoffrey Crowther](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geoffrey_Crowther,_Baron_Crowther "Geoffrey Crowther, Baron Crowther"), then editor of *[The Economist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Economist "The Economist")*, "If the economic relationships between nations are not, by one means or another, brought fairly close to balance, then there is no set of financial arrangements that can rescue the world from the impoverishing results of chaos."<sup id="cite_ref-outline_74-1" class="reference"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-outline-74"><span class="cite-bracket">[</span>72<span class="cite-bracket">]</span></a></sup><sup class="reference nowrap"><span title="Page: 336">: 336 </span></sup> 

These ideas were informed by events prior to the [Great Depression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Depression "Great Depression") when – in the opinion of Keynes and others – international lending, primarily by the US, exceeded the capacity of sound investment and so got diverted into non-productive and speculative uses, which in turn invited default and a sudden stop to the process of lending.<sup id="cite_ref-outline_74-2" class="reference"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-outline-74"><span class="cite-bracket">[</span>72<span class="cite-bracket">]</span></a></sup><sup class="reference nowrap"><span title="Pages: 368–372">: 368–372 </span></sup> 

Influenced by Keynes, economics texts in the immediate post-war period put a significant emphasis on balance in trade.

> [Lenin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vladimir_Lenin "Vladimir Lenin") is said to have declared that the best way to destroy the Capitalist System was to debauch the currency. By a continuing process of inflation, governments can confiscate, secretly and unobserved, an important part of the wealth of their citizens. There is no subtler, no surer means of overturning the existing basis of society than to debauch the currency. The process engages all the hidden forces of economic law on the side of destruction, and does it in a manner which not one man in a million is able to diagnose.

**Views on alienation**

Keynes was not deeply concerned with alienation and did not explicitly use the term in his writings. While Keynes was pro-business and viewed capitalism as essential for economic growth, he acknowledged that it created economic insecurity and dissatisfaction, which could alienate workers, yet he believed this was only a temporary problem. In his book the Economic Possibilities for Our Grandchildren (1930), he envisioned a future where society would become so wealthy that the pursuit of money for its own sake would become irrelevant, effectively eliminating alienation.<sup id="cite_ref-83" class="reference"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-83"><span class="cite-bracket">[</span>81<span class="cite-bracket">]</span></a></sup> He believed that continuous economic growth would eventually reduce the need for excessive labor and alleviate extreme inequality, allowing people to pursue more fulfilling lives. While Keynes' optimistic vision has not fully materialized, global wealth has grown significantly since his time. Yet, alienation remains a pressing issue, especially during periods of rising inequality, suggesting that economic growth alone may not be enough to eliminate the problem.

Main article: [Keynesian Revolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keynesian_Revolution "Keynesian Revolution")

From the end of the Great Depression to the mid-1970s, Keynes provided the main inspiration for economic policymakers in Europe, America and much of the rest of the world.<sup id="cite_ref-K_rev._and_critics_61-3" class="reference"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-K_rev._and_critics-61"><span class="cite-bracket">[</span>59<span class="cite-bracket">]</span></a></sup> While economists and policymakers had become increasingly won over to Keynes's way of thinking in the mid and late 1930s, it was only after the outbreak of World War II that governments started to borrow money for spending on a scale sufficient to eliminate unemployment. According to the economist [John Kenneth Galbraith](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Kenneth_Galbraith "John Kenneth Galbraith") (then a US government official charged with controlling inflation), in the rebound of the economy from wartime spending, "one could not have had a better demonstration of the Keynesian ideas".<sup id="cite_ref-Heights1_84-0" class="reference"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-Heights1-84"><span class="cite-bracket">[</span>82<span class="cite-bracket">]</span></a></sup>

The [Keynesian Revolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keynesian_Revolution "Keynesian Revolution") was associated with the rise of [modern liberalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_liberalism "Social liberalism") in the West during the post-war period.<sup id="cite_ref-85" class="reference"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-85"><span class="cite-bracket">[</span>83<span class="cite-bracket">]</span></a></sup> Keynesian ideas became so popular that some scholars point to Keynes as representing the ideals of modern liberalism, as Adam Smith represented the ideals of [classical liberalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_liberalism "Classical liberalism").<sup id="cite_ref-86" class="reference"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-86"><span class="cite-bracket">[</span>84<span class="cite-bracket">]</span></a></sup> After the war, [Winston Churchill](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winston_Churchill "Winston Churchill") attempted to check the rise of Keynesian policy-making in the United Kingdom and used rhetoric critical of the [mixed economy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mixed_economy "Mixed economy") in his [1945 election](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1945_United_Kingdom_general_election "1945 United Kingdom general election") campaign.

#### Neo-Keynesian economics

\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=John_Maynard_Keynes&action=edit&section=17 "Edit section: Neo-Keynesian economics")\]

[Neo-Keynesian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neo-Keynesian_economics "Neo-Keynesian economics") [IS–LM model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IS%E2%80%93LM_model "IS–LM model") is used to analyse the effect of [demand shocks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demand_shock "Demand shock") on the economy.

In the late 1930s and 1940s, economists (notably [John Hicks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Hicks "John Hicks"), [Franco Modigliani](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franco_Modigliani "Franco Modigliani") and [Paul Samuelson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Samuelson "Paul Samuelson")) attempted to interpret and formalise Keynes's writings in terms of formal [mathematical models](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_model "Mathematical model"). In what had become known as the [neoclassical synthesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neoclassical_synthesis "Neoclassical synthesis"), they combined Keynesian analysis with [neoclassical economics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neoclassical_economics "Neoclassical economics") to produce [neo-Keynesian economics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neo-Keynesian_economics "Neo-Keynesian economics"), which came to dominate [mainstream macroeconomic thought](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mainstream_economics "Mainstream economics") for the next 40 years.

By the 1950s, Keynesian policies were adopted by almost the entire developed world and similar measures for a [mixed economy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mixed_economy "Mixed economy") were used by many developing nations. By then, Keynes's views on the economy had become mainstream in the world's universities. Throughout the 1950s and 1960s, the developed and emerging free capitalist economies enjoyed exceptionally high growth and low unemployment.<sup id="cite_ref-87" class="reference"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-87"><span class="cite-bracket">[</span>85<span class="cite-bracket">]</span></a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-solution_88-0" class="reference"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-solution-88"><span class="cite-bracket">[</span>86<span class="cite-bracket">]</span></a></sup> Professor Gordon Fletcher has written that the 1950s and 1960s, when Keynes's influence was at its peak, appear in retrospect as a [golden age of capitalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post%E2%80%93World_War_II_economic_expansion "Post–World War II economic expansion").<sup id="cite_ref-K_rev._and_critics_61-4" class="reference"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-K_rev._and_critics-61"><span class="cite-bracket">[</span>59<span class="cite-bracket">]</span></a></sup>

In late 1965 *[Time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_\(magazine\) "Time (magazine)")* magazine ran a cover article with a title comment from [Milton Friedman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milton_Friedman "Milton Friedman") (later echoed by US President [Richard Nixon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Nixon "Richard Nixon")), "[We are all Keynesians now](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/We_are_all_Keynesians_now "We are all Keynesians now")". The article described the exceptionally favourable economic conditions then prevailing and reported that "Washington's economic managers scaled these heights by their adherence to Keynes's central theme: the modern capitalist economy does not automatically work at top efficiency, but can be raised to that level by the intervention and influence of the government." The article also states that Keynes was one of the three most important economists who ever lived, and that his *[General Theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_General_Theory_of_Employment,_Interest_and_Money "The General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money")* was more influential than the *magna opera* of other famous economists, such as [Adam Smith](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_Smith "Adam Smith")'s *[The Wealth of Nations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wealth_of_Nations "The Wealth of Nations")*.<sup id="cite_ref-89" class="reference"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-89"><span class="cite-bracket">[</span>87<span class="cite-bracket">]</span></a></sup>

#### Multiplier

The concept of the multiplier was first developed by [R. F.

### Keynesian economics out of favour 1979–2007

\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=John_Maynard_Keynes&action=edit&section=19 "Edit section: Keynesian economics out of favour 1979–2007")\]

Main article: [Post-war displacement of Keynesianism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post-war_displacement_of_Keynesianism "Post-war displacement of Keynesianism")

Keynesian economics were officially discarded by the British Government in 1979, but forces had begun to gather against Keynes's ideas over 30 years earlier. [Friedrich Hayek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friedrich_Hayek "Friedrich Hayek") had formed the [Mont Pelerin Society](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mont_Pelerin_Society "Mont Pelerin Society") in 1947, with the explicit intention of nurturing intellectual currents to one day displace Keynesianism and other similar influences. Its members included the [Austrian School](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austrian_School "Austrian School") economist [Ludwig von Mises](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ludwig_von_Mises "Ludwig von Mises") along with the then-young Milton Friedman. Initially, the society had little impact on the wider world – according to Hayek it was as if Keynes had been raised to sainthood after his death and that people refused to allow his work to be questioned.<sup id="cite_ref-Heights1_84-2" class="reference"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-Heights1-84"><span class="cite-bracket">[</span>82<span class="cite-bracket">]</span></a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-93" class="reference"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-93"><span class="cite-bracket">[</span>91<span class="cite-bracket">]</span></a></sup> Friedman, however, began to emerge as a formidable critic of Keynesian economics from the mid-1950s, and especially after his 1963 publication of *[A Monetary History of the United States](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Monetary_History_of_the_United_States "A Monetary History of the United States")*.

On the practical side of economic life, "[big government](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_government "Big government")" had appeared to be firmly entrenched in the 1950s, but the balance began to shift towards the power of private interests in the 1960s. Keynes had written against the folly of allowing "decadent and selfish" speculators and financiers the kind of influence they had enjoyed after World War I. For two decades after World War II public opinion was strongly against private speculators, the disparaging label "[Gnomes of Zurich](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gnomes_of_Zurich "Gnomes of Zurich")" being typical of how they were described during this period. International speculation was severely restricted by the capital controls in place after Bretton Woods. According to the journalists [Larry Elliott](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larry_Elliott "Larry Elliott") and [Dan Atkinson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dan_Atkinson "Dan Atkinson"), 1968 was the pivotal year when power shifted in favour of private agents such as currency speculators. As the key 1968 event Elliott and Atkinson picked out America's suspension of the conversion of the dollar into gold except on request of foreign governments, which they identified as the beginning of the breakdown of the Bretton Woods system.<sup id="cite_ref-failedgods_94-0" class="reference"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-failedgods-94"><span class="cite-bracket">[</span>92<span class="cite-bracket">]</span></a></sup>

Criticisms of Keynes's ideas had begun to gain significant acceptance by the early 1970s, as they were then able to make a credible case that Keynesian models no longer reflected economic reality. Keynes himself included few formulas and no explicit mathematical models in his *General Theory*. For economists such as [Hyman Minsky](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyman_Minsky "Hyman Minsky"), Keynes's limited use of mathematics was partly the result of his scepticism about whether phenomena as inherently uncertain as economic activity could ever be adequately captured by mathematical models. Nevertheless, many models were developed by Keynesian economists, with a famous example being the [Phillips curve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phillips_curve "Phillips curve") which predicted an inverse relationship between unemployment and inflation. It implied that unemployment could be reduced by government stimulus with a calculable cost to inflation. In 1968, Milton Friedman published a paper arguing that the fixed relationship implied by the Philips curve did not exist.<sup id="cite_ref-95" class="reference"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-95"><span class="cite-bracket">[</span>93<span class="cite-bracket">]</span></a></sup> Friedman suggested that sustained Keynesian policies could lead to both unemployment and inflation rising at once – a phenomenon that soon became known as [stagflation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stagflation "Stagflation"). In the early 1970s stagflation appeared in both the US and Britain just as Friedman had predicted, with economic conditions deteriorating further after the [1973 oil crisis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1973_oil_crisis "1973 oil crisis"). Aided by the prestige gained from his successful forecast, Friedman led increasingly successful criticisms against the Keynesian consensus, convincing not only academics and politicians but also much of the general public with his radio and television broadcasts. The academic credibility of Keynesian economics was further undermined by additional criticism from other [monetarists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monetarist "Monetarist") trained in the [Chicago school of economics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_school_of_economics "Chicago school of economics"), by the [Lucas critique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucas_critique "Lucas critique") and by criticisms from Hayek's Austrian School.<sup id="cite_ref-K_rev._and_critics_61-5" class="reference"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-K_rev._and_critics-61"><span class="cite-bracket">[</span>59<span class="cite-bracket">]</span></a></sup> So successful were these criticisms that by 1980 [Robert Lucas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Lucas,_Jr. "Robert Lucas, Jr.") claimed economists would often take offence if described as Keynesians.<sup id="cite_ref-Blinder_96-0" class="reference"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-Blinder-96"><span class="cite-bracket">[</span>94<span class="cite-bracket">]</span></a></sup>

Keynesian principles fared increasingly poorly on the practical side of economics – by 1979 they had been displaced by monetarism as the primary influence on Anglo-American economic policy.<sup id="cite_ref-K_rev._and_critics_61-6" class="reference"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-K_rev._and_critics-61"><span class="cite-bracket">[</span>59<span class="cite-bracket">]</span></a></sup> However, many officials on both sides of the Atlantic retained a preference for Keynes, and in 1984 the [Federal Reserve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve_System "Federal Reserve System") officially discarded monetarism, after which Keynesian principles made a partial comeback as an influence on policy-making.<sup id="cite_ref-97" class="reference"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-97"><span class="cite-bracket">[</span>95<span class="cite-bracket">]</span></a></sup> Not all academics accepted the criticism against Keynes – Minsky has argued that Keynesian economics had been debased by excessive mixing with neoclassical ideas from the 1950s, and that it was unfortunate that this branch of economics had even continued to be called "Keynesian".<sup id="cite_ref-Minksky_35-5" class="reference"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-Minksky-35"><span class="cite-bracket">[</span>35<span class="cite-bracket">]</span></a></sup> Writing in *[The American Prospect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_American_Prospect "The American Prospect")*, [Robert Kuttner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Kuttner "Robert Kuttner") argued it was not so much excessive Keynesian activism that caused the economic problems of the 1970s but the breakdown of the Bretton Woods system of [capital controls](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capital_control "Capital control"), which allowed [capital flight](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capital_flight "Capital flight") from regulated economies into unregulated economies in a fashion similar to [Gresham's law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gresham%27s_law "Gresham's law") phenomenon (where weak currencies undermine strong ones).<sup id="cite_ref-98" class="reference"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-98"><span class="cite-bracket">[</span>96<span class="cite-bracket">]</span></a></sup> Historian [Peter Pugh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Pugh "Peter Pugh") has stated that a key cause of the economic problems afflicting America in the 1970s was the refusal to raise taxes to finance the [Vietnam War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vietnam_War "Vietnam War"), which was against Keynesian advice.<sup id="cite_ref-forBeginners_99-0" class="reference"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-forBeginners-99"><span class="cite-bracket">[</span>97<span class="cite-bracket">]</span></a></sup>

A more typical response was to accept some elements of the criticisms while refining Keynesian economic theories to defend them against arguments that would invalidate the whole Keynesian framework – the resulting body of work largely composing [New Keynesian economics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Keynesian_economics "New Keynesian economics"). In 1992 [Alan Blinder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Blinder "Alan Blinder") wrote about a "Keynesian Restoration", as work based on Keynes's ideas had to some extent become fashionable once again in academia, though in the mainstream it was highly synthesised with monetarism and other neoclassical thinking. In the world of policy making, [free market](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_market "Free market") influences broadly sympathetic to monetarism have remained very strong at government level – in powerful normative institutions like the [World Bank](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Bank "World Bank"), the [IMF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IMF "IMF") and [US Treasury](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US_Treasury "US Treasury"), and in prominent opinion-forming media such as the *[Financial Times](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_Times "Financial Times")* and *[The Economist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Economist "The Economist")*.<sup id="cite_ref-100" class="reference"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-100"><span class="cite-bracket">[</span>98<span class="cite-bracket">]</span></a></sup>

A series of major [bailouts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bailout "Bailout") were pursued during the [2008 financial crisis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2008_financial_crisis "2008 financial crisis"), starting on 7 September 2008 with the announcement that the US Government was to nationalise the two [government-sponsored enterprises](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government-sponsored_enterprise "Government-sponsored enterprise") which oversaw most of the US subprime mortgage market – [Fannie Mae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fannie_Mae "Fannie Mae") and [Freddie Mac](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freddie_Mac "Freddie Mac"). In October, [Alistair Darling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alistair_Darling "Alistair Darling"), the British [Chancellor of the Exchequer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chancellor_of_the_Exchequer "Chancellor of the Exchequer"), referred to Keynes as he announced plans for substantial [fiscal stimulus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stimulus_\(economics\) "Stimulus (economics)") to head off the worst effects of recession, in accordance with Keynesian economic thought.<sup id="cite_ref-116" class="reference"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-116"><span class="cite-bracket">[</span>114<span class="cite-bracket">]</span></a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-Times_Darling_117-0" class="reference"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-Times_Darling-117"><span class="cite-bracket">[</span>115<span class="cite-bracket">]</span></a></sup> Similar policies have been adopted by other governments worldwide.<sup id="cite_ref-118" class="reference"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-118"><span class="cite-bracket">[</span>116<span class="cite-bracket">]</span></a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-119" class="reference"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-119"><span class="cite-bracket">[</span>117<span class="cite-bracket">]</span></a></sup> This was in stark contrast to the action imposed on [Indonesia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indonesia "Indonesia") during the [1997 Asian financial crisis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1997_Asian_financial_crisis "1997 Asian financial crisis"), when it was forced by the IMF to close 16 banks at the same time, prompting a [bank run](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_run "Bank run").<sup id="cite_ref-120" class="reference"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-120"><span class="cite-bracket">[</span>118<span class="cite-bracket">]</span></a></sup> Much of the post-crisis discussion reflected Keynes's advocacy of international coordination of fiscal or monetary stimulus, and of international economic institutions such as the IMF and the World Bank, which many had argued should be reformed as a "new Bretton Woods", and should have been even before the crises broke out.<sup id="cite_ref-MarkwellPeace_121-0" class="reference"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-MarkwellPeace-121"><span class="cite-bracket">[</span>119<span class="cite-bracket">]</span></a></sup> The IMF and United Nations economists advocated a coordinated international approach to fiscal stimulus.<sup id="cite_ref-autogenerated1_122-0" class="reference"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-autogenerated1-122"><span class="cite-bracket">[</span>120<span class="cite-bracket">]</span></a></sup> [Donald Markwell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Markwell "Donald Markwell") argued that in the absence of such an international approach, there would be a risk of worsening international relations and possibly even world war arising from economic factors similar to those present during the depression of the 1930s.<sup id="cite_ref-MarkwellRelations_114-1" class="reference"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-MarkwellRelations-114"><span class="cite-bracket">[</span>112<span class="cite-bracket">]</span></a></sup>

In February 2009 [Robert J. Shiller](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_J._Shiller "Robert J.

In the March 2009 speech entitled *Reform the International Monetary System*, [Zhou Xiaochuan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zhou_Xiaochuan "Zhou Xiaochuan"), the governor of the [People's Bank of China](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/People%27s_Bank_of_China "People's Bank of China"), came out in favour of Keynes's idea of a centrally managed global reserve currency. Zhou argued that it was unfortunate that part of the reason for the Bretton Woods system breaking down was the failure to adopt Keynes's [bancor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bancor "Bancor"). Zhou proposed a gradual move towards increased use of IMF [special drawing rights](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_drawing_rights "Special drawing rights") (SDRs).<sup id="cite_ref-124" class="reference"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-124"><span class="cite-bracket">[</span>122<span class="cite-bracket">]</span></a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-125" class="reference"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-125"><span class="cite-bracket">[</span>123<span class="cite-bracket">]</span></a></sup> Although Zhou's ideas had not been broadly accepted, leaders meeting in April at the [2009 G-20 London summit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2009_G-20_London_summit "2009 G-20 London summit") agreed to allow $250 billion of special drawing rights to be created by the IMF, to be distributed globally.

Both organisations warned global leaders that recovery was likely to be slow, so counter-recessionary measures ought not be rolled back too early.

While the need for stimulus measures was broadly accepted among policymakers, there had been much debate over how to fund the spending. Some leaders and institutions, such as [Angela Merkel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angela_Merkel "Angela Merkel")<sup id="cite_ref-129" class="reference"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-129"><span class="cite-bracket">[</span>127<span class="cite-bracket">]</span></a></sup> and the [European Central Bank](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Central_Bank "European Central Bank"),<sup id="cite_ref-130" class="reference"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-130"><span class="cite-bracket">[</span>128<span class="cite-bracket">]</span></a></sup> expressed concern over the potential impact on inflation, national debt and the risk that a too-large stimulus will create an unsustainable recovery.

Among professional economists the revival of Keynesian economics has been even more divisive. Although many economists, such as George Akerlof, Paul Krugman, Robert Shiller and Joseph Stiglitz, supported Keynesian stimulus, others did not believe higher government spending would help the United States economy recover from the [Great Recession](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Recession "Great Recession").

### New Keynesian economics

\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=John_Maynard_Keynes&action=edit&section=21 "Edit section: New Keynesian economics")\]

Main article: [New Keynesian economics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Keynesian_economics "New Keynesian economics")

New Keynesian economics developed in the 1990s and early 2000s as a response to the critique that macroeconomics lacked [microeconomic foundations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microfoundations "Microfoundations"). New Keynesianism developed models to provide microfoundations for Keynesian economics. It incorporated parts of [new classical macroeconomics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_classical_macroeconomics "New classical macroeconomics") to develop the [new neoclassical synthesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_neoclassical_synthesis "New neoclassical synthesis"), which forms the basis for [mainstream macroeconomics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mainstream_economics "Mainstream economics") today.<sup id="cite_ref-135" class="reference"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-135"><span class="cite-bracket">[</span>133<span class="cite-bracket">]</span></a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-136" class="reference"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-136"><span class="cite-bracket">[</span>134<span class="cite-bracket">]</span></a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-137" class="reference"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-137"><span class="cite-bracket">[</span>135<span class="cite-bracket">]</span></a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-138" class="reference"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-138"><span class="cite-bracket">[</span>136<span class="cite-bracket">]</span></a></sup>

Two main assumptions define the New Keynesian approach to macroeconomics. Like the New Classical approach, New Keynesian macroeconomic analysis usually assumes that households and firms have [rational expectations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rational_expectations "Rational expectations"). However, the two schools differ in that New Keynesian analysis usually assumes a variety of [market failures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_failure "Market failure"). In particular, New Keynesians assume that there is [imperfect competition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperfect_competition "Imperfect competition")<sup id="cite_ref-139" class="reference"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-139"><span class="cite-bracket">[</span>137<span class="cite-bracket">]</span></a></sup> in price and wage setting to help explain why prices and wages can become "[sticky](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sticky_\(economics\) "Sticky (economics)")", which means they do not adjust instantaneously to changes in economic conditions.

Wage and price stickiness, and the other market failures present in New Keynesian [models](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_\(macroeconomics\) "Model (macroeconomics)"), imply that the economy may fail to attain [full employment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full_employment "Full employment"). Therefore, New Keynesians argue that macroeconomic stabilisation by the government (using [fiscal policy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiscal_policy "Fiscal policy")) and the [central bank](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_bank "Central bank") (using [monetary policy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monetary_policy "Monetary policy")) can lead to a more [efficient](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_efficiency "Pareto efficiency") macroeconomic outcome than a *[laissez faire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laissez_faire "Laissez faire")* policy would.
