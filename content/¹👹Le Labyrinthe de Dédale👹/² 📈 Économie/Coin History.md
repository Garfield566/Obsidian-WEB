**coin**, a piece of metal or, rarely, some other material (such as leather or porcelain) certified by a [mark](https://www.britannica.com/money/mark-German-currency) or marks upon it as being of a specific intrinsic or exchange value.

The use of cast-metal pieces as a medium of exchange is very ancient and probably developed out of the use in commerce of ordinary [ingots](https://www.britannica.com/technology/ingot) of [bronze](https://www.britannica.com/technology/bronze-alloy) and other metals that possessed an [intrinsic value](https://www.britannica.com/money/intrinsic-value). Until the development of [bills of exchange](https://www.britannica.com/money/bill-of-exchange) in medieval Europe and paper [currency](https://www.britannica.com/money/currency) in medieval China, metal coins were the only such medium. Despite their diminished use in most commercial transactions, coins are still indispensable to modern economies; in fact, their importance is growing as the result of the widespread use of coin-operated machines. For a discussion of paper currencies, *see* [money](https://www.britannica.com/money/money).

## Coins as historical data

Being made in most ages of precious [metal](https://www.britannica.com/science/metal-chemistry), or alternatively possessing a substantial token value, coins have always been prized, often hoarded, and, therefore, frequently buried for safety. The contents of such savings banks have been dug up in all ages, so that the coins of past civilizations continue to be found in vast numbers. Studied alongside literary or archaeological evidence, they yield a wide range of information that is especially valuable for chronology and [economic history](https://www.britannica.com/money/economic-history). Coins may reflect the wealth and power of cities and states, and study of their distribution may help to define the physical extent of territorial dominion or to illustrate major commercial connections. Thus, the popularity in ancient times of Athenian coins in the Levant and of Corinthian silver in [Magna Graecia](https://www.britannica.com/place/Magna-Graecia) (southern Italy) testifies to established trade links. Finds of early Roman imperial gold in India corroborate the reference of the Roman historian [Pliny the Elder](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Pliny-the-Elder) to the drain on Roman gold to pay for Indian and other Eastern luxuries. Likewise, huge finds of Arab silver coins in Scandinavia show the extent of trade, in particular the demand for furs by the ʿAbbāsid caliphs and the Sāmānid rulers of Iran. One result of such widespread commercial contacts is that certain currencies acquired special international preeminence. In ancient times, those of Athens, Corinth, and [Philip II](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Philip-II-king-of-Macedonia) of Macedon were widely popular. The uniform [coinage](https://www.britannica.com/money/coinage) of Philip’s son [Alexander the Great](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Alexander-the-Great) was struck at mints widely scattered throughout his vast empire and was universally accepted. In medieval times, the gold dinars (a term derived from the Roman denarius) of the early caliphs and the gold ducats of Florence and Venice played a similar role—as did the silver dollars of Mexico, the [Maria Theresa](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Maria-Theresa) of Austria, and the gold sovereigns of Great Britain in modern times. Moreover, the study of depreciation and debasement of coinage may illuminate past national financial distress. For example, the heavily alloyed 3rd-century- ad Roman antoniniani (coins introduced by the Roman emperor Caracalla, originally having a value of two denarii) tell their tale as clearly as the depreciating paper currency of Germany in and after 1919.

No less valuable than the economic evidence yielded by a comparative study of coins is their purely [documentary](https://www.britannica.com/topic/documentation) importance. Together with [medals](https://www.britannica.com/topic/medal), they present an unrivaled series of historical portraits from the 4th century bc to the present day, many of them otherwise unknown, like the Greco-Bactrian kings or certain usurpers during the Roman Empire. Greek coinage is a particularly notable contribution to the history of art, displaying not only the beauty and strength of many artistic traditions but also (like Roman coinage) the miniature likenesses of numerous large-scale sculptural and architectural works now lost. The imperial coinage of Rome, apart from its portraiture, is important above all for the remarkable detail of its chronological and political content; and from both [Greek](https://www.britannica.com/place/ancient-Greece) and Roman coins much can be learned of [mythology](https://www.britannica.com/topic/myth) and religion. The Christian influences active in medieval Europe can be similarly measured from medieval currencies.

The principal metals of which ancient coins were made were [electrum](https://www.britannica.com/science/electrum), [gold](https://www.britannica.com/science/gold-chemical-element), [silver](https://www.britannica.com/science/silver), [copper](https://www.britannica.com/science/copper), [brass](https://www.britannica.com/technology/brass-alloy), and [bronze](https://www.britannica.com/technology/bronze-alloy) —all of them more or less resistant to decay. Their use at first was generally dictated by availability. The earliest coins of [Asia Minor](https://www.britannica.com/place/Anatolia) were of electrum, a natural occurring [alloy](https://www.britannica.com/technology/alloy) washed from Lydian rivers (electrum was later produced artificially). Gold became the major currency metal of southwestern Asia as a whole, being derived from Scythian, Pontic, and Bactrian sources. The city-states of the Greek mainland preferred the silver that adjacent mines supplied, and the mines of [Italy](https://www.britannica.com/topic/history-of-Italy) led to the choice of bronze for the earliest coinage of Rome. With the development of internal economies and external trade, gold, silver, and copper or bronze quickly came to be used side by side; [Philip II](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Philip-II-king-of-Macedonia) of Macedon popularized gold in Greece, but it became paramount only in the Byzantine and Arab empires and in the great commercial currencies of the Italian republics of the 13th century onward. Silver, however, was nearly always powerful in Roman currency and was the major coinage metal of Europe from the 8th to the 13th century. Bronze or copper was first used for small change in Greece from the late 5th century bc and in the Roman and Byzantine systems as well; the vast currency of China consisted of base metals down to modern times.

The foregoing metals furnished most currencies until the early 20th century, when the appreciation in value of gold and silver and the need to economize led to the general production of [paper](https://www.britannica.com/technology/paper) currencies for the higher units of value. Token units of lower value expressed in terms of [nickel](https://www.britannica.com/science/nickel-chemical-element) (used, exceptionally, in [Bactria](https://www.britannica.com/place/Bactria) in the 2nd century bc), [cupronickel](https://www.britannica.com/technology/cupronickel), bronze, and, in times of postwar stress, [aluminum](https://www.britannica.com/science/aluminum) and [aluminum bronze](https://www.britannica.com/technology/aluminum-bronze) supplemented precious metals in some countries. [Lead](https://www.britannica.com/science/lead-chemical-element), which may easily decay, has seldom been used for coinage, except by the Andhras (inhabitants of the Deccan in ancient India), in pre-Roman Gaul, and in the more recent coinages of the Malay states. [Iron](https://www.britannica.com/science/iron-chemical-element), very occasionally used in antiquity—e.g., in Sparta—reappeared in German coins of [World War I](https://www.britannica.com/event/World-War-I). [Zinc](https://www.britannica.com/science/zinc) was employed by Rome as a constituent of fine brass coins and as an element in the alloy of a few Chinese coins from the 15th to the 17th century. Base [metals](https://www.britannica.com/science/tin) furnished the material for some Celtic coins in Gaul and Britain in the last century bc. In crises, currencies have been produced from leather, cloth, card, paper, and other materials.

### Origins of coins

In both the East and the West, [coinage](https://www.britannica.com/money/coinage) proper was preceded by more primitive currencies, nonmonetary or semi-monetary, which survived into the historic age of true coins, and may have derived originally from the [barter](https://www.britannica.com/money/barter-trade) of cattle, implements, and the like. The earliest [currency](https://www.britannica.com/money/currency) of China of the 8th century bc consisted of miniature hoes and billhooks (pruning implements), with inscriptions indicating the authority. The small bronze [celts](https://www.britannica.com/technology/celt-tool) (prehistoric tools resembling chisels) and bronze rings frequently found in hoards in western Europe probably played a monetary role. Even in modern times such mediums of exchange as fishhook currency have been known.

Metal has always achieved wide popularity as an exchange medium, being durable, divisible, and portable; and the origins of true coinage lie there. [Ancient Egypt](https://www.britannica.com/place/ancient-Egypt), which was using [gold](https://www.britannica.com/science/gold-chemical-element) bars of set weight from the 4th millennium bc, eventually developed a currency of gold rings (but it did not adopt the use of coinage in [foreign trade](https://www.britannica.com/money/international-trade) until the late 4th century ad). In the [Middle East](https://www.britannica.com/place/ancient-Middle-East), gold rings long served the dual purposes of adornment and currency, supplemented by gold and [silver](https://www.britannica.com/science/silver) bars from which segments could be cut. The choice of metal was, as usual, determined by availability. Around the [Aegean Sea](https://www.britannica.com/place/Aegean-Sea), heavy [copper](https://www.britannica.com/science/copper) ingots were used as currency several centuries before the invention of true coinage. These ingots, known as [talents](https://www.britannica.com/science/talent-unit-of-weight), were originally a unit of weight of roughly 55 to 60 pounds (more than 25 kg); talents were later used as a measure of value. The discovery of an iron bar with a handful (*[drachma](https://www.britannica.com/money/drachma)*) of fractional iron spits (*obeloi*) dedicated in the Heraeum (a temple of the goddess Hera) at [Argos](https://www.britannica.com/place/Argos), perhaps as part of King [Pheidon](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Pheidon) of Argos’ reforms of [weights and measures](https://www.britannica.com/topic/weights-and-measures) in the 7th century bc, shows such currency continuing until historical times. Similar bundles of spits have been found elsewhere and are evidence of the desire to subdivide a cumbersome unit into smaller fractions for normal use. At the other end of the scale, there was, ultimately, the desire to express the value of a talent of copper or iron in terms of gold or silver; and Homer, who speaks of metal basins, tripods, and axes as gifts and prizes in a way that shows them as a recognized standard of wealth, also speaks of the talent of gold (i.e., the value of a heavy base-metal talent expressed in a little pellet of gold). In [Italy](https://www.britannica.com/topic/history-of-Italy) rough lumps of bronze (*aes rude*) formed a currency from early times, being succeeded by bars of regular weight; and Julius Caesar’s record of the ancient British use of iron bars as currency (following his raids on Britain in 55 and 54 bc) is still borne out by not infrequent finds.

Such “heavy” currencies, mainly characteristic of European lands, show the employment of metals from which implements would normally be made. The impact upon this system of the gold of the East, and later of the silver of Greece, produced the need to value such metals in gold and silver, and this in turn resulted in the need to control and guarantee the quantity of gold and silver so used to avoid constant weighing. Once gold (and then silver) gained acceptance as conveniently small expressions of relatively high value, with a visible [mark](https://www.britannica.com/money/mark-German-currency) of guarantee, the stage of true coinage, as it first appeared in [Asia Minor](https://www.britannica.com/place/Anatolia) and India, had been reached. Not all lands, however, adopted true coinage: the easternmost fringes of the Greek world lacked it, and Carthage and Etruria were without coinage until the 5th century ad.

## Ancient Greek coins

### Early developments, c. 650–490 bc

True coinage began soon after 650 bc. The 6th-century Greek poet Xenophanes, quoted by the historian [Herodotus](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Herodotus-Greek-historian), ascribed its invention to the [Lydians](https://www.britannica.com/place/Lydia-ancient-region-Anatolia), “the first to strike and use coins of gold and silver.” King [Croesus](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Croesus) of [Lydia](https://www.britannica.com/place/Lydia-ancient-region-Anatolia) (reigned *c.* 560–546 bc) produced a bimetallic system of pure gold and pure silver coins, but the foundation deposit of the Artemisium (temple to Artemis) at Ephesus shows that [electrum](https://www.britannica.com/science/electrum) coins were in production before Croesus, possibly under King Gyges. Croesus’ earliest coins were of electrum, which the Greeks called “white gold.” They were stamped on one side with the facing heads of a lion and a bull; this type was later transferred to his bimetallic series of pure gold and pure silver. (Some recent scholarship, however, suggests that this latter series was struck, in fact, under Croesus’ Persian successors.)

The early electrum coinage consisted of small, thick, bean-shaped pieces, with a device stamped in relief on one side, the other being roughly impressed. Their [intrinsic value](https://www.britannica.com/money/intrinsic-value) fluctuated according to their gold and silver content; but the weight of the unit was fairly steady at about seven to eight grams, and the types stamped on them were the guarantee of authority.

Croesus’ relations with Greece were close, and his bimetallic system may have owed something to the fact that Greece had itself now produced its first silver coins. The oldest are of [Aegina](https://www.britannica.com/place/Aegina-island-Greece), with, obverse, a turtle—associated with Aphrodite—and, reverse, an incuse square. Tradition—e.g., in [Julius Pollux](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Julius-Pollux), the 2nd-century- ad Greek scholar, and elsewhere—regarded these as struck by [Pheidon](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Pheidon) of Argos in virtue of his supremacy over Aegina; but the coins are too late to claim association with him in Aegina. They began no earlier than the late 7th century, when Aeginetan maritime ascendancy was growing, incidentally spreading the Aeginetan weight standard for coinage, based on a [drachma](https://www.britannica.com/money/drachma) of about six grams, over much of the Peloponnese and also the Aegean, where similar currency was produced in the islands. Ambition and pride stimulated two neighbouring powers to strike their own coins. [Corinth](https://www.britannica.com/place/Corinth-Greece) with its pegasi (from their constant obverse type of a [pegasus](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Pegasus-Greek-mythology)) was coining silver from about 575 with a light drachma of about three grams, and it is reasonably certain that in Athens, in the first half of the 6th century, Attic coins, based on a drachma of about 4.25 grams derived from Euboea and with a variety of obverse types, including an owl (the reverses, like those of the Corinthian pegasi, were impressed with a die design), were supplanting the earlier coinage of Aegina. These early silver coins, while much less valuable intrinsically than the electrum and gold coins of Asia Minor, nevertheless possessed considerable purchasing power: the Aeginetan and Attic-Euboic didrachms and the Corinthian tridrachm were high denominations suitable for major commerce and not for everyday life. For intercity transactions these staters (i.e., standard units) were conveniently linked by the mina weight (1 / 60 of a talent) of 425 grams, made up by 150 Corinthian, 100 Attic, and 70 Aeginetan drachmas. Fractional pieces developed only slowly.

Between 550 and 500 commerce and civic pride had spread coinage to many parts of the Greek world. From the Persian Empire, with its vast gold and silver coinage, successor to that of Croesus, to [Magna Graecia](https://www.britannica.com/place/Magna-Graecia) and Sicily, and from the Dorian colony of Cyrene to the Greek or semi-Greek cities of Thrace, there was a network of varied and competitive currencies, generally of fine quality and steady weight. Improved minting techniques began to affect their appearance. A second type, in relief, was substituted gradually for the roughly impressed reverse punch. The important effect of this on the development of coin types is well seen in the reorganized coinage of [Athens](https://www.britannica.com/place/Athens) from about 525, in which the obverse bears the [Athena](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Athena-Greek-mythology) head and the reverse the owl of Athens—religious patron and civic device; the monarch’s head on an English penny goes back, through Alexander’s deified head, to the head of Athena, and the symbol of Britannia derives ultimately from such state badges as the owl. In certain cities of Italy and [Sicily](https://www.britannica.com/place/Sicily), however, including Tarentum and Metapontum, a different technique was popular, the obverse type in relief being repeated intaglio on the reverse, very probably with the object of concealing the older types of coins imported for restriking. For a long time the early coins of Greece carried no inscriptions or, at most, with very rare exceptions, a letter or two referring to the issuing city or state authority.

Greek coin types, early and even later, were simple in conception and often taken from the [animal](https://www.britannica.com/animal/animal) world. They include many kinds of animals (with the bull, symbol of a river, very common); birds (such as the owl of Athens, the eagle of [Zeus](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Zeus) at Olympia, the dove at Sicyon); insects (like the bee of Ephesus); fabulous creatures (like the [griffin](https://www.britannica.com/topic/griffin-mythological-creature) at Abdera); and vegetable objects. Not uncommonly such types were chosen as punning allusions to a city’s name—the lion at Leontini; the goat at Aegae; the quince at Melos; the sickle-shaped harbour at Zancle; the *selinon* leaf at Selinus; the cock, harbinger of *hemera,* the day, at Himera. In others a city’s staple product was proclaimed, like silphium at Cyrene, a silver-miner’s pick at Damastium, a bunch of grapes at Naxos, a wine jar at Chios. Cult associations frequently dictated the choice of type. Tarentum showed its mythical founder, the dolphin-rider Taras; Knossos, the [Minotaur](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Minotaur) (half man, half bull) or Labyrinth; Croton, the [tripod](https://www.britannica.com/topic/tripod-furniture) of [Apollo](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Apollo-Greek-mythology); Poseidonia, a statue of [Poseidon](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Poseidon), god of the sea. Human or anthropomorphic figures, however, were comparatively rare on early Greek coins, though the famous gold darics, a name derived from [Darius I](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Darius-I), and silver [shekels](https://www.britannica.com/money/sheqel) of Persia showed the great king in an attitude of attack.

Much more popular was the representation of idealized heads of deities, which, once established for the two Athenas, Parthenos and Chalinitis, at Athens and Corinth, quickly became the vogue elsewhere, encouraged by the development of double-relief coinage (i.e., coinage with obverse and reverse in relief), which allowed the head of a civic deity to be paired on the other side by the city’s symbol. The Greek tyrants, as a rule, chose to respect the theory of coinage as the corporate expression of state economy and thus regarded coinage as too important a matter for private production. The traditions that, rightly or wrongly, associated all the great lawgivers—Pheidon, Solon, and Lycurgus—with the institution of coinage as well as with reform of weights emphasize its position as a fundamentally corporate right.

In [Sicily](https://www.britannica.com/place/Sicily) the defeat of Carthage in 480 bc may have been commemorated by the famous [decadrachms](https://www.britannica.com/topic/decadrachm) (*Demareteia*) associated with Queen Demarete, wife of King Gelon. These superb and now very rare examples of early classical genius showed on the obverse the head of [Arethusa](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Arethusa-Greek-mythology) (the fountain nymph of Syracusan Ortygia), wreathed (possibly for victory), and on the reverse a chariot above a fleeing lion.

### From the Persian Wars to Alexander the Great, 490–336 bc

For a century and a half the previous pattern of Greek [coinage](https://www.britannica.com/money/coinage) spread widely all over the Greek world, its quantity stimulated by a growing sense of nationalism, its intrinsic quality kept high by commercial competition, and its technique raised to new and often superb levels in an age of self-confidence. In the last half of the period the designing and [engraving](https://www.britannica.com/art/engraving) of coin [dies](https://www.britannica.com/technology/die) (punches) reached a standard rarely to be surpassed. The head of a patron deity was now generally established as the obverse type and was often shown in very high relief, sometimes indeed facing, as a tour de force. Engravers, especially in Sicily and Italy, began to sign their dies, thus preserving the names of masters such as the Syracusans Euainetos, [Cimon](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Cimon-of-Cleonae), and Eukleidas, otherwise unknown. Reverse types, now more complex, increasingly showed groups or genre scenes—e.g., the splendid frontally squatting Silenus (foster father of the wine god Dionysus) on the coinage for the refounding of Sicilian Naxos in 461, [Dionysus](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Dionysus) seated backward on a donkey at Mende, or the many mythological compositions on Cretan coins—often diminishing the previous importance of the city badge. Inscriptions, though still often contracted, were in general use. The principal coinage metal was [silver](https://www.britannica.com/science/silver), of which the Attic weight standard gradually conquered the Aeginetan. Electrum was continued in the east—at Cyzicus, Lampsacus, Mytilene, and Phocaea—traveling thence mainly to the Black Sea; in the west it was coined at Carthage. In both areas it was produced as an artificial [alloy](https://www.britannica.com/technology/alloy). Gold was continued in the darics of the Persian kings and in the fine later series of Lampsacene staters; it was also struck at Panticapaeum on the [Black Sea](https://www.britannica.com/place/Black-Sea) and on occasion at Syracuse, Tarentum, and Cyrene. Toward the end of the period, Philip II of Macedon instituted what was to be a world-famous [gold](https://www.britannica.com/science/gold-chemical-element) coinage, undercutting and ousting that of Persia. Bronze made its appearance late in the 5th century, replacing the minute silver obol and other fractional silver coins that had hitherto been used as small change.

The currencies of the period included a few that were of world importance. The silver of Corinth and its Adriatic colonies was very numerous and was abundantly accepted, outside the Corinthian territories, by Italy and Sicily. The [electrum](https://www.britannica.com/science/electrum) of Cyzicus bore types that deliberately recommended it to many markets. Persian gold and silver coins enjoyed immense popularity in the 5th century. Metapontum, Tarentum, Thurium, Velia, and Syracuse were among the more prolific silver mints of the west. But the most famous commercial [currency](https://www.britannica.com/money/currency) of all was that of Athens, the silver tetradrachms of which were struck in large numbers, fine quality, and obstinately unchanged appearance. These coins traveled widely in trade and were imitated as far afield as Egypt, Arabia, and Persia.

### Predominance of Athens

Economic expansion and naval hegemony gave Athens near-imperial control over its allies in the 5th century. It may have been as early as 449 that Athenian edicts forbade the striking of silver coins by the allies or the use of currency, weights, and measures other than the Athenian and provided that previously minted local currencies should be handed in for exchange against that of Athens. The subjection of [Aegina](https://www.britannica.com/place/Aegina-island-Greece) to Athens from 456 and the cessation of its famous and long-competitive “turtles” facilitated the monetary dominance of the “owls,” which was carried further, stage by stage, as Athenian “allies” revolted, were reconquered, and lost their independence. But the embargo put by Athens on local silver coinage was not absolute and perhaps was not expected to be. Major allies such as Samos, Chios, and Lesbos continued their own currencies; Phocaea, Mytilene, and Cyzicus, though ceasing to coin in silver, continued with electrum. In other cities, small change in silver was issued. Beyond the effective range of Athenian power, cities in Pamphylia (e.g., Aspendus) and in Thrace (e.g., Abdera and Aenus) could continue silver coinage on a non-Attic standard, and the failure of Athenian control is seen in the sudden and often beautiful coinages of cities that threw aside its dominance, such as Olynthus from about 430, or in the changed weight standard of others (e.g., Acanthus). During the [Peloponnesian War](https://www.britannica.com/event/Peloponnesian-War), Sparta cut off the supply of silver from the Laurium mines, and by 407 Athens was melting the gold Nikai (victory statues) from the Parthenon to make emergency coins, followed the next year by bronze small change—an unpopular substitute for the tiny silver coins previously carried in the mouth. City after city now rebelled against Athens, and there was a sudden burst of independent coinage.

Athenian coinage revived, with unchanged types, after the Athenian admiral Conon’s successes against the Spartan fleet in 394. But wary former allies formed defensive leagues, as shown by current coinage, with a type of the Greek hero [Heracles](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Heracles) and the inscription ΣΥΝ (“the alliance”), by Cnidus, Ephesus, Samos, Byzantium, and other cities under Rhodian leadership. Rhodes spread its own coinage (with its head of the sun-god Helios and punning badge of a rose—Rhodon) widely in the eastern Mediterranean. Phocaea and Mytilene established a [monetary union](https://www.britannica.com/money/monetary-union) for their electrum. From 404 the Aeginetans were coining again, and on their former weight standard, though with a tortoise replacing the turtle. Corinthian coins continued to pour out. In the north a variety of important mints opened, and coins from mints in [Asia Minor](https://www.britannica.com/place/Anatolia), notably Cnidus and Ephesus, testify to the prosperity brought by autonomy.

### Artistic development

In contrast to the deliberate archaism of Athenian types, a wide flowering was seen elsewhere. Sometimes this was the result of hybridizing influence, as when Greek artists rendered Scythian motifs at Panticapaeum or Punic ones for Carthage and such of its Sicilian colonies as Segesta and Eryx. Sometimes an artistic tradition was regional, harsh, and arresting, as in [Crete](https://www.britannica.com/place/Crete) or, as in Massilia and Emporion in the far west, a weak reflection of finer styles. Generally, however, there was an internationally high standard in coin design. Elis, guardian of the temple of Olympian [Zeus](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Zeus) and famous for its quadrennial [Olympic Games](https://www.britannica.com/sports/Olympic-Games), no doubt attempted to impress visitors with its superb [coinage](https://www.britannica.com/money/coinage). On the coins issued from about 500 to 322, the thunderbolt and eagle of Zeus were shown with Victory in various attitudes; later the heads of Zeus and Hera were nobly represented. In northern Greece brilliant artistry characterized the coins of Amphipolis, Acanthus, and Chalcidian Olynthus. The coins of Clazomenae and Cnidus in eastern Greece were also notable for their designs.

It was in [Italy](https://www.britannica.com/topic/history-of-Italy) and [Sicily](https://www.britannica.com/place/Sicily) that the finest work appeared. In Italy, Tarentine [silver](https://www.britannica.com/science/silver) continued its type of Taras on a dolphin. In the middle of the 5th century the agonistic type showing a horseman appeared; the celebrated Tarentine cavalry was thus commemorated down to the middle of the 4th century. About 340 Tarentum issued very beautiful [gold](https://www.britannica.com/science/gold-chemical-element) coins with a head of [Persephone](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Persephone-Greek-goddess) and, on the reverse, the infant Taras appealing to Zeus enthroned. Heraclea, founded in the middle of the 5th century, issued fine staters with a helmeted Athena and Heracles seated or strangling or wrestling with a lion. Metapontum introduced a most striking head of its founder, [Leucippus](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Leucippus). Other mints of the time were at Neapolis, with its types of the siren Parthenope and her father, the man-headed bull Achelous; at Velia, with its head of a nymph and, on the reverse, the eastern type of a lion attacking a bull; at Thurium, with its unusually fine head of Athena and the powerful bull on the reverse; and at Terina, remarkable for its beautiful treatment of the Victory type.

In Sicily, and particularly in [Syracuse](https://www.britannica.com/place/Syracuse-Italy), the [engraver](https://www.britannica.com/art/engraving) ’s art reached perfection. The coins of Syracuse showed many varieties of the heads of Arethusa and Persephone, and the chariot of the reverse was found capable of varied treatment. After the middle of the 5th century, artists began to sign their work, and it is thus possible to prove that other towns engaged engravers from Syracuse. The Syracusan coinage was mainly silver. During the siege by the Athenians, beautiful little gold coins were struck with, reverse, Heracles strangling a lion. With the prosperity following the enemy’s defeat, Syracusan art reached its zenith. As the Demareteion commemorated the defeat of the Carthaginians, so the great series of decadrachms perpetuated the memory of the victory of 413 over the Athenians. The agonistic types and the word *athla* on some of them show that they were distributed at the games held to celebrate the victory; their types were widely copied, and their engravers, Cimon and Euainetos, gained a place among the world’s greatest artists.

Among other cities of Sicily there was a notable series from [Acragas](https://www.britannica.com/place/Agrigento) in the 5th century, with its beautiful double-eagle type, seen most magnificently on the rare and famous decadrachms. Camarina showed fine types of the river god Hipparis and the nymph Camarina on a swan. [Himera](https://www.britannica.com/place/Himera), before its destruction in 409, issued some very interesting types, such as the nymph Himera sacrificing while Silenus beside her bathes at the [thermal spring](https://www.britannica.com/science/hot-spring) for which Himera was noted; or [Pelops](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Pelops) (a grandson of Zeus) in his chariot, referring to a victory of a Himeran at the Olympic Games, which Pelops is said to have founded. Catana used the artist Heracleidas to design a splendid facing head of [Apollo](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Apollo-Greek-mythology). [Selinus](https://www.britannica.com/place/Selinus-ancient-city-Sicily) abandoned its parsley leaf and issued some remarkable types, notably that of Apollo and [Artemis](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Artemis-Greek-goddess) in their quadriga and, on the reverse, the local hero sacrificing at an altar, alluding to the cessation of the plague as a result of appeals to Apollo as healer.

### From Alexander the Great to the end of the Roman Republic, c. 336–31 bc

Alexander introduced a new era in coinage, struck in vast quantities at a variety of mints from [Macedonia](https://www.britannica.com/place/Macedonia-ancient-kingdom-Europe) to Babylon with uniform types and weights. After his death in 323 bc the [Diadochi](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Diadochoi) (“Successors”—a reference to the chief officers who partitioned his empire) were to reflect the importance of his coinage in their own differentiated issues— [Seleucus](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Seleucus-I-Nicator) in Syria, Philip Arrhidaeus in Macedonia, [Lysimachus](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Lysimachus) in Thrace, and Ptolemy in [Egypt](https://www.britannica.com/place/ancient-Egypt), where, except for tentative gold coined by Tachos and [Nectanebo II](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Nectanebo-II) between 361 and 343, no coinage had previously been struck. Alexander’s influence on the Greek fringe was no less marked. The Arsacid kings of Parthia instituted a Greek style of coinage, as did Bactrian kings, culminating in the splendid portrait decadrachms of Amyntas circa 150 bc, while, even farther to the southeast, Indo-Greek kings struck coins, inscribed in both Greek and Prākrit, to the end of the 2nd century. The flood of coins of Philip II and Alexander, penetrating Europe from the Balkans, resulted in progressive imitations by Celtic peoples westward along the Danube until these imitations themselves influenced coins in Gaul and Britain in the 1st century bc. In the Mediterranean west, by contrast, Greek coinage yielded to the steady advance of Roman power; the late issues of Spain and Mauretania were of hybrid Greco-Roman origin.

### The coin portrait

The coinage of Alexander established a new style: the coin portrait became an almost regular feature in Greek [currency](https://www.britannica.com/money/currency) that was predominantly regal. The portrait, however, was not at first that of a living monarch. Philip II and Alexander were content with their names on their coins, of which the obverses showed, for Philip, Apollo and Zeus and, for Alexander, Heracles and Athena. Alexander added the title basileus (king) only after his Persian conquest. After his death his deified portrait appeared on the coins of [Lysimachus](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Lysimachus) in Thrace and on the early coins of [Ptolemy I](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Ptolemy-I-Soter) in Egypt. It was not until 306 that a living king put his own portrait on his coins, when Ptolemy I appeared, still as god, with the aegis of Zeus. [Seleucus I](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Seleucus-I-Nicator) similarly put himself on his coins as Dionysus; in time the divine attribute was dropped, and the ruler appeared as a mortal wearing only the royal diadem. In Macedonia, Arrhidaeus, Cassander, and Antigonus still followed the types of Alexander; and the early coins of [Demetrius I Poliorcetes](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Demetrius-I-Poliorcetes) (336–283) were without a portrait. Soon, however, his own portrait appeared, still with the horns that deify him. His successor had only types of deities. Pyrrhus did not appear on any of his extensive coinages, but the last two kings of Macedonia, Perseus and Philip V, left very fine portraits. The kings of [Pontus](https://www.britannica.com/place/Pontus-ancient-district-Turkey), notably Mithradates VI, had a magnificent series of portraits. The kings of [Pergamum](https://www.britannica.com/place/Pergamum) used the same portrait throughout, that of the founder of the dynasty, Philetairus I, and the Ptolemies in Egypt throughout their long series used only the head and legend of Ptolemy I, except on certain special issues. Among the early Seleucids, Antiochus I was reluctant to drop the portrait of Seleucus I, but the portrait of the reigning monarch became the rule.

After the vast issues of gold by Philip II, Alexander (under whom its price in relation to silver cheapened to 1:10 from 1:13 or more), and Lysimachus, gold was but rarely struck. Silver was the general metal of coinage; the Attic standard, which Alexander had adopted for his tetradrachms, became the monetary standard of the Western world, and there was a great increase in the bronze coinage. Egypt, however, kept to its own standards and to gold.

As the greater part of the Greek world was now ruled by the Diadochi, their various coinages naturally formed the main currencies of commerce. Third-century Athenian coinages were scarce except in bronze. In 229, however, Macedonia lost its supremacy over Athens, and friendly relations were established between Athens and Rome. Shortly after 200 the abundant issue of tetradrachms of the “new style” began, which went on for slightly more than a century, replacing the “archaic” Athena with a copy of the head of the Parthenos of the Athenian sculptor [Phidias](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Phidias), and with an owl on the reverse perched on a Panathenaic amphora. Corinth went on striking its stater until 229, when, with its surrender to [Antigonus III Doson](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Antigonus-III-Doson), king of Macedonia from 227, the long series came to an end.

### Rise of Rome

After the Roman conquest of Greece it is clear from the resumed activity of the mints that the Greek cities were autonomous in one respect at least, for the [silver](https://www.britannica.com/science/silver) [coinage](https://www.britannica.com/money/coinage) required in Greek territory could be supplied only by Greek mints, the task being beyond the power of Rome at this time. The [Thessalians](https://www.britannica.com/place/Thessaly) issued silver coins of the type of Zeus and Athena and the legend *Thessalon;* a similar coinage was issued by the Boeotians. Maronea and [Thasos](https://www.britannica.com/place/Thasos) issued tetradrachms that became a great commercial [currency](https://www.britannica.com/money/currency) for trade across the Danube with the Scythians and Celts who imitated them. Macedonia itself issued tetradrachms bearing the names of Roman governors. In Asia, after the defeat of Antiochus III at Magnesia, there was an outburst of tetradrachms of Attic weight and local types at towns such as Lampsacus, Smyrna, and Magnesia. Other cities resumed the issue of Alexander tetradrachms, continuing to the middle of the 2nd century, when the Roman province of Asia was set up and cistophori replaced them. These, so called from the Dionysian chest (the sacred box or basket carried in the worship of Dionysus, usually shown containing snakes), which formed the principal type, were first struck at Pergamum after 228 bc; the reverse is a bow in a case between two serpents.

In the west the rise of Rome in the 3rd century introduced a new factor into the history of Greek coinage. The first coinage to disappear was that of [Etruria](https://www.britannica.com/place/Etruria-ancient-country-Italy) —a silver issue curiously always left blank on one side—after a life of two centuries. Rome’s early intercourse with the Greek cities of Italy is reflected in the Romano-Campanian coinage. In the south the Italian campaign of Pyrrhus left its [mark](https://www.britannica.com/money/mark-German-currency) on various coinages, notably at Tarentum. The towns of [Magna Graecia](https://www.britannica.com/place/Magna-Graecia) gradually lost their silver coinage under Roman influence, although Greek bronze coins lasted until the 1st century at Paestum.

In Sicily in the 3rd century, derivatives of earlier Syracusan coinage began to dominate the whole island. The [Punic Wars](https://www.britannica.com/event/Punic-Wars) brought the Romans to Sicily, where the Carthaginians had been established since the end of the 5th century and had struck coins of Syracusan and other Sicilian types with Punic legends and later with their own types. Sicily became a Roman province; henceforth, only bronze was struck in it, and these local coins continued into the first century, when the last trace of Greek coinage in the west disappeared.

### Subsidiary Greek silver coinages under the Roman Empire

Although Greek coins under the Roman Empire were nearly all of bronze and intended for local circulation, exceptional coinages in silver were allowed by Rome as a continuation, for wider regional use, of important preconquest currencies. The largest of these, running from Augustus to Diocletian’s coinage reform, was minted at Alexandria to supply the needs of Egypt and was generally of billon (an [alloy](https://www.britannica.com/technology/alloy) of silver and base metals). Inscriptions were in Greek and obverses bore the emperor’s portrait, while reverses (dated in regnal years by Greek numerals) showed a wide variety of types embracing Hellenistic, Roman, and Egyptian symbolism.

In [Syria](https://www.britannica.com/place/Syria) silver tetradrachms continued to be struck, mainly at Antioch but also at Tyre and some other mints. These gradually became baser in the course of the early 3rd century. Bronze was also struck by the Romans at these mints and frequently bears the letters *S C* (*Senatus consulto*), showing, like similar issues at Rome, imperial initiative exerted through senatorial agency. Of several other local silver coinages the large series of drachmas struck at Caesarea in Cappadocia from Tiberius to Commodus is the most important. The most usual type was a local one of Mount Argaeus.

A number of vassal states and protectorates continued to issue their own coinages in the precious metals until they became Roman provinces. The only [gold](https://www.britannica.com/science/gold-chemical-element) coinage of this kind is that of the kings of the [Bosporus](https://www.britannica.com/place/Kingdom-of-the-Bosporus), who struck coins from the time of Augustus to the beginning of the 4th century. This coinage became gradually debased. In Africa the kings of [Mauretania](https://www.britannica.com/place/Mauretania-region-North-Africa) issued their own gold and silver until ad 40.

### Coinage in Judaea

Another pre-imperial series continued under the Roman Empire was that of Judaea. Except for rare silver coins of much earlier date, with types of Greek origin but marked with brief Hebrew inscriptions, there were no Judaean issues until about 135 bc; the Seleucid coinage of Syria had in the meantime supplied the necessary currency. Antiochus VII, however, had granted to the Hasmonean high priest Simon Maccabeus the right of coinage, which enabled the natural resistance of the [Maccabees](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Maccabees) to Greek polytheism to be satisfied by the representation of specifically Jewish symbols. These coins, like those of the rest of the dynasty, were of [copper](https://www.britannica.com/science/copper). [Alexander Jannaeus](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Alexander-Jannaeus) (103–76 bc) was the first of the Maccabean priestly princes to style himself king on his coins, which bore his name and title in Greek as well as Hebrew, but Pompey’s withdrawal of the kingly title was reflected in the coins of [John Hyrcanus II](https://www.britannica.com/biography/John-Hyrcanus-II). [Antigonus Mattathias](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Antigonus-Mattathias) (40–37 bc), the last of the Maccabees, introduced the seven-branched candlestick as a type. Under the Herodian dynasty, from 37 bc, Greek alone was found on Judaean coins. [Herod Philip](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Philip-king-of-Judaea) (4 bc – ad 34) gravely infringed Jewish convention by showing the effigy of the Roman emperor; [Herod Agrippa I](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Herod-Agrippa-I) (41–44) was more adroit, avoiding the imperial portrait in Judaea but introducing his own in Caesarea.

From ad 66, silver shekels and halves were coined, with some bronze, at “Jerusalem the Holy” to mark the first [revolt](https://www.britannica.com/event/First-Jewish-Revolt) against Rome: issues of year 5 (ad 70–71), a precarious one for the insurgents, are very rare. After the Flavian conquest, there were no further Jewish coins until the second revolt (132–135), under [Bar Kokhba](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Bar-Kokhba-Jewish-leader), when silver and bronze briefly proclaimed “the redemption of Israel and the freedom of Jerusalem.” Jewish coinage ceased with the revolt’s collapse.

### Greek bronze imperial coinage, to ad 268

Under the Roman Republic many Greek cities and districts continued to issue their own bronze coins, and, particularly in Asia, these local Greek coinages went on under the empire down to Gallienus.

The right of coinage in Greece was sometimes continuous and sometimes intermittently permitted by the emperor or governor. Coins were struck not only by single towns but also jointly by alliances of towns (*homonoiai*). The general type is everywhere the same: obverse, a bust and, reverse, a type of local interest. Under the republic the Greek cities usually placed on the obverses of their coins an allegorical bust of some local hero, the local city goddess, or a personification of the people, the municipal council, or the senate. The [Tyche](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Tyche), the titular goddess of the city, appears as a female bust wearing a mural [crown](https://www.britannica.com/money/crown-monetary-unit). The goddess Roma is found as a helmeted female; e.g., at Smyrna. Under the empire the usual obverse type is the head of the emperor, as on the imperial series proper. There are some notable exceptions. Macedonia, for example, had the head of [Alexander the Great](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Alexander-the-Great). Athens was privileged by Hadrian to use the head of Athena in place of the emperor’s.

It is the reverse types of this series of coins that give them their importance. The coins of Athens preserve representations of many statues famous in antiquity that have long since perished, such as the Athena Parthenos of Phidias; the great Athena Promachos on the Acropolis, visible far out at sea; or the Dionysus of Alcamenes, possibly a pupil of Phidias. A coin of Elis preserves the Olympian [Zeus of Phidias](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Statue-of-Zeus), and one of Lacedaemon the [Apollo](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Apollo-Greek-mythology) of Amyclae, near Sparta. Local cults and incidents in the lives of the Greek divinities are common types. Local celebrities are also recorded, for example, [Homer](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Homer-Greek-poet) at several of the various towns that claimed him as a native (notably Smyrna), [Anacreon](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Anacreon) at Teos, [Sappho](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Sappho-Greek-poet) at Eresus in Lesbos, [Herodotus](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Herodotus-Greek-historian) at [Halicarnassus](https://www.britannica.com/place/Halicarnassus), and [Alcaeus](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Alcaeus) at Mytilene, which recorded on its coins a whole series of its famous men, most otherwise unknown. Reverse types also represent many architectural views of great importance, and the celebration of games and festivals is frequently recorded on coins.

In conclusion, mention may be made of a notable example of the preservation of a local tradition on a Greek imperial coin. On a coin of Septimius at Apameia in Phrygia there appear as reverse type a man and woman in a chest or ark floating on water, with a raven on the top and a dove flying above with a branch in its beak; to remove any doubt about the scene represented, the ark is labeled ΝΩ (NO; Noah), and the coin is evidence of the local tradition that the ark rested on the mountain behind Apameia.

## Roman coins, republic and empire

### The beginnings

Although Roman [coinage](https://www.britannica.com/money/coinage) soon diverged from Greek conventions, its origins were similar. Rome, founded in the 8th century bc, had no true coinage until the 3rd. Roman historians later attributed coinage unhesitatingly to the much earlier regal period: some derived *nummus* (“coin”) from [Numa Pompilius](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Numa-Pompilius), by tradition Rome’s second king, and [Servius Tullius](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Servius-Tullius) was credited with [silver](https://www.britannica.com/science/silver) coinage, as well as with [bronze](https://www.britannica.com/technology/bronze-alloy) stamped with the device of cattle. Roman historical tradition, however, seriously confused the elements of the true picture. Rough, unworked lumps of bronze (aes rude) were certainly used as a metal [currency](https://www.britannica.com/money/currency) from the 6th century, if not much earlier, perhaps in rare conjunction with very small quantities of unworked [gold](https://www.britannica.com/science/gold-chemical-element) and silver, themselves also passing by weight. Simultaneously, standards of value appear to have been expressed in terms of cattle and sheep, as is clear not only from the derivation of *pecunia* (“money”) from *pecus* (“cattle,” or “sheep”) but also from the early assessment of fines in oxen and sheep. From this it was falsely concluded that bronze coins marked with the device of cattle existed from the 6th century. In fact, the expression of values in terms of cattle may have lasted, officially, into the 5th century, for it was not until the decemvirs (a legislative commission) codified the law and drew up the [Twelve Tables](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Law-of-the-Twelve-Tables) (451–449 bc) that fines were fixed in bronze. This bronze still consisted of unworked lumps or, at most, rough bars of irregular weight.

During the 4th century bc, Roman contact with the Greek cities of southern Italy slowly increased; these included such prolific [mint](https://www.britannica.com/money/mint-metallurgy) cities as Nola, Hyria, and Naples. The coinages of these cities consisted of silver didrachms, of which Rome presumably made use in any necessary dealings with them. A hint is given, however, of widening Roman monetary interests by two issues of bronze token coinage. These, though certainly not produced at Rome, may perhaps be regarded as the earliest coins in the name of the Romans, struck at Naples about 325–285 within the terms of their alliance and intended for use in Campania, as distinct from Rome and Latium. It is unlikely, indeed, that a mint in the proper sense existed at Rome before 289, the year to which Pomponius assigned the establishment of *[tresviri](https://www.britannica.com/topic/triumvirate)* (a board of three officials) who should be *aeris flatores* (“bronze melters”); and this mint (in the temple of Juno Moneta) did not yet produce true coins but aes signatum, bronze bars (of about six pounds) lacking a [mark](https://www.britannica.com/money/mark-German-currency) of value but bearing on each side a clearly recognizable type (including cattle) and perhaps equivalent in value to a Greek silver didrachm.

These aes signatum bars were halfway between aes rude and true coinage. In 269 true coinage appeared. It consisted of aes grave, large circular cast coins of bronze all bearing marks of value, from the [as](https://www.britannica.com/topic/as) (weighing one pound) down to its 12th, the uncia; the obverses showed the head of a deity, the reverses a ship’s prow. These were paralleled at mints elsewhere by similar cast coins; their types showed not, as at Rome, Latin deities but rather Greek (in the south) or Umbrian and Oscan. At the same time, there appeared struck silver didrachms, on the standard of the Greek silver coins of Campania, bearing Greek types but marked *ROMANO* or *ROMA.* Accompanied by small struck bronze token coins, these were issued from Campanian mints, and they probably continued to the [Second Punic War](https://www.britannica.com/event/Second-Punic-War), terminating in a new issue of silver coins of Roman style and types (marked *ROMA*), including Jupiter in a quadriga (four-horse chariot) from which their name, quadrigati, derived; they were imitated in [electrum](https://www.britannica.com/science/electrum) by the Carthaginians in Capua. The quadrigati were of the weight of the lighter Romano-Campanian didrachms and reflected the rising cost of silver at a time of stress; concurrently the cast bronze coinage of Rome dropped steadily in weight from an as of one pound to one of three ounces or less. Financial stress is similarly to be seen in the exceptional issue of gold units and halves. Toward the end of the Second Punic War the quadrigati were replaced by silver coins of half their weight, with a Victory on the reverse, and hence called victoriates. By about 190 a mainly silver coinage, Latin-inscribed, was in production at Rome and other authorized mints, accompanied by bronze coinage so greatly reduced in standard (and thus size) that it could at last be struck instead of being cast.

### Introduction of the denarius

Adjustment of the previously fluctuating relationship between bronze and silver was first secured by the issue about 211 bc of the silver denarius (marked *X* —i.e., 10 bronze asses), together with fractional coins, also of silver (marked *V* —i.e., five; and *IIS* —i.e., 2 1 / 2 asses—a sesterce, or sestertius). The denarii were lighter than the quadrigati; their types were a Roma head on the obverse, with the [Dioscuri](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Dioscuri) (the twin deities Castor and Pollux) and *ROMA* on the reverse. Their production came to be confined principally to the mint of Rome. The victoriates, again lighter (their weight standard had come from Illyria), were issued until about 150 bc, being perhaps intended for principal circulation outside Italy. The denarius, however, quickly established itself as the major currency in the central and western Mediterranean. In its eastward expansion, Rome learned to make use of local currencies—gold staters of Macedonia and silver tetradrachms of Athens or Asia. Rome was also prepared to employ Macedonian gold in the west, as was shown by the release to western markets of large quantities of gold staters after about 150 bc. In the 2nd century bc, Roman coinage in gold was exceptional. Coinage in bronze, however, continued, but further variation in silver–bronze values was seen in two developments. The as dropped in weight to that of an uncia and then less, becoming a token currency; together with its fractions, it was now always struck and not cast. The value of the denarius in terms of bronze was altered, being revalued about 133 at 16 instead of 10 asses; the silver quinarius (now of eight asses and with the types of the victoriate) became rare; and the silver [sesterce](https://www.britannica.com/topic/sesterce) (now equal to four asses) virtually disappeared. After about 80 bc the striking of bronze was discontinued until the time of Caesar.

These developments mirrored the economic difficulties of the day. Reduction of the weight of the as from one to 1 / 2 ounce in 89 bc was accompanied temporarily by debasement of the denarius, resulting in the issue of denarii with serrated edges, intended to show that they were not plated (*see* [plating](https://www.britannica.com/technology/plating)).

### Control and content of the coinage

The [coinage](https://www.britannica.com/money/coinage) was controlled by the Senate, acting for the sovereign people; and the conduct of the mints was in the hands of boards of junior magistrates, the *tresviri.* From about the mid-2nd century, each of a [mint’s](https://www.britannica.com/money/mint-metallurgy) three *tresviri* normally issued coins bearing his own name, and on special occasions these were supplemented by issues of quaestors, curule aediles, prefects, or praetors; these were distinguished by special inscriptions such as *ex s* (*enatus*) *c* (*onsulto*) and *ex a* (*rgento*) *p* (*ublico*)*.* The function of all these officials was quantity and quality control.

The moneyers’ names at first were shown as simple monograms. The Dioscuri reverse was followed by Diana or Victory in a biga (two-horse chariot), and these again by figures of Jupiter, Juno, or [Apollo](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Apollo-Greek-mythology) in a quadriga, with the moneyers’ names in fuller form. In the mid-2nd century bc, however, newer tendencies appeared, as when Sextus Pompeius Fostlus paired the Roma obverse with a reverse showing his traditional ancestor Faustulus discovering the wolf and twins; the reference was to the greatness of Rome, but it was to be seen through the lineage of a moneyer. Later republican denarii gave keen expression to party politics, as when corn ears recorded circa 100 the purchase of grain by the quaestors Piso and Caepio, or the head of Ceres with ploughing oxen proclaimed the program of the Marians, or Sextus Nonius Sufenas advertised the games that he had staged as praetor.

It was in the provinces, however, that the republican coinage took the decisive steps toward its finally imperial character. Campaigning generals began, in the 1st century bc, to operate mints for paying their troops in the field. In Italy mint policy had usually looked beyond personal politics to the state. But the military coinages of the *imperatores* equated the state with the personalities of the generals. Such were the aurei and denarii struck from eastern mints about 82–81 by [Sulla](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Sulla), with, obverse, *L. SVLLA* and head of Venus (his family patroness) and, reverse, *IMPER* (*ator*) *ITERVM,* priestly jug between trophies. [Pompey](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Pompey-the-Great) issued comparable aurei about 61 (also in the east). From these precedents the earlier coinage of Julius Caesar followed naturally in the late 50s and early 40s, with, obverse, *CAESAR* and elephant (the family badge) and, reverse, priestly symbols, or obverse, head of Venus (his traditional ancestress) and, reverse, *CAESAR,* Gaulish trophy, and captives. Such coinages still avoided the portraiture of a living man, the only examples of which hitherto had been on provincially struck coins.

### Caesar and after

In the last year of his life, [Caesar](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Julius-Caesar-Roman-ruler) developed personal control of the coinage to a point at which it lay ready to hand for Augustus to use later as a fully imperial instrument. Already, from 46 bc, coinage in [gold](https://www.britannica.com/science/gold-chemical-element) had been instituted in Rome by Caesar’s lieutenant [Hirtius](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Aulus-Hirtius). Caesar’s seizure of the treasury and his expansion of the annual board of moneyers from three to four members indicated his intention to deal absolutely with the coinage. In 44, denarii were issued in considerable quantity by his *quattuorviri,* bearing the portrait of Caesar on the obverse, with such inscriptions as *DICT* (*ator*) *QVART* (*um*) or *DICT* (*ator*) *PERPETVO,* and Venus Victrix or other semipersonal reverse types. For the token coinage a new [alloy](https://www.britannica.com/technology/alloy) was now first struck—yellow orichalcum or [brass](https://www.britannica.com/technology/brass-alloy), a copper–zinc alloy. Caesar may have enjoyed a monopoly of zinc from mines in [Cisalpine Gaul](https://www.britannica.com/place/Cisalpine-Gaul).

From 44 to 31, bronze coinages were struck at various non-Italian mints, notably in or around Sicily, by officials attached to the cause of one or other of the members of the second triumvirate— [Antony](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Mark-Antony-Roman-triumvir), Octavian, and Lepidus. But the principal issues of these years were of gold and [silver](https://www.britannica.com/science/silver). The mint of Rome continued its regular series until about 37 and then ceased. Antony’s coinage emanated at first from Gaul, then increasingly from eastern mints, including his cistophori and denarii (some showing his head conjoined with [Cleopatra](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Cleopatra-queen-of-Egypt) ’s) struck in Asia: his vast issue of often base denarii showing warships and military standards, shortly before the naval battle of Actium, was eastern. Octavian coined mainly in Gaul, Italy, and Africa. The piratical movement of Sextus Pompeius was reflected in the activity of a mint or mints in Sicily.

It was characteristic of most of the gold and silver after 44 that it showed portraits of the rival statesmen on the obverses, with reverses that alluded to their achievements or policies. This was true even of the “liberators” who murdered Caesar, for a famous eastern issue in the name of [Brutus](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Marcus-Junius-Brutus) showed his portrait, with *BRVT* (*us*) *IMP* (*erator*) on the obverse, with reverse *EID* (*ibus*) *MAR* (*tiis*)—the fatal Ides of March—and daggers flanking a cap of liberty. By the close of the Roman Republic, three factors had entirely transformed the originally simple idiom of the early denarial coinage: gold was freely struck in addition to silver; the types of both were personal to military leaders and included living portraiture; and coinage could be produced elsewhere than at Rome.

### Early imperial mint policy

[Augustus](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Augustus-Roman-emperor) (27 bc – ad 14) based the [coinage](https://www.britannica.com/money/coinage) on the [aureus](https://www.britannica.com/topic/aureus) of 1 / 42 of a pound of [gold](https://www.britannica.com/science/gold-chemical-element), equivalent to 25 denarii, each of 1 / 84 of a pound of [silver](https://www.britannica.com/science/silver), the metals being struck almost pure. The denarius was valued at 16 asses. Token coinage consisted henceforth of brass sesterces and dupondii (equal to four and two asses, respectively), with [copper](https://www.britannica.com/science/copper) asses, halves, and quarters, the as being the most common. [Nero](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Nero-Roman-emperor) in ad 64 lightened aureus and denarius to 1 / 45 and 1 / 96, respectively, but debasement of silver subsequently took place. Under [Septimius Severus](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Septimius-Severus) it reached 40 percent, and Caracalla issued a debased double denarius of the weight of only 1 1 / 2 denarii. Gallienus’ double denarius of copper and silver, leached to give a more silver-rich surface, marked a monetary breakdown, only partially cured when Diocletian and Constantine again made gold the firm basis for supplementary pure silver and abundant copper coinage.

Augustus’ earliest gold and silver were coined chiefly in the east—e.g., at Ephesus and Pergamum—and more briefly at Emerita in Spain. Bronze also was mainly eastern, though some was struck at Nemausus (Nîmes). The Rome [mint](https://www.britannica.com/money/mint-metallurgy) was reopened about 20 bc for gold and silver and remained open for this purpose until about 12 bc; its bronze continued irregularly. From 12 bc, Lugdunum ([Lyon](https://www.britannica.com/place/Lyon-France)), with other mints of uncertain identity, undertook the main western coinages in gold, silver, and bronze. After 64 Rome was once more the chief mint for all metals. Official mintages were supplemented by a mass of regional or local coinages, while official coinages from eastern mints provided necessary [currency](https://www.britannica.com/money/currency) for local Roman frontier forces.

The bronze of Rome was marked *S* (*enatus*) *C* (*onsulto*) and continued to bear the names of the *tresviri monetales* —masters of the mint, now reduced to their traditional number—until 4 bc. But *S C* also appeared on bronze from Lyon and Antioch in imperial provinces, showing that whatever nominal senatorial rights of coinage still lingered on—the *tresviri* are known until the 3rd century—the emperor wielded effective control over all metals everywhere. This was logical, since his economic powers were equally comprehensive. In fact, the old senatorial mint was transferred from the temple of Juno Moneta on Rome’s Capitoline Hill and merged, probably after the fire of 64, with an imperial mint for gold and silver elsewhere in the capital. Henceforth, it worked in sections—six were normal later—controlled immediately by an imperial procurator and staffed by slaves or freedmen.

### Portraits and types

The use of Caesar’s own portrait upon coinage set a precedent; although under Augustus and Tiberius token denominations occasionally lacked the imperial portrait, it was thereafter an essential element of virtually every gold, silver, and bronze coin of the official mints, as also of nearly all provincial and local coins. Emphasis on the personality of the emperor (extended sometimes to empresses, sons, or deceased members of the imperial house) was a powerful propaganda instrument in a coinage that circulated throughout a vast empire. The great series of imperial portraits, from Augustus to Romulus in ad 476, is artistically outstanding. Many of the finest appeared on the large brass sesterces down to the 3rd century and on the even larger bronze medallions produced for presentation; but particular care was taken over the portraits for gold, which, being softer, showed a beautiful and highly sensitive impression. Nothing is known of the portrait artists, though it is likely that they were often from the Greek East.

Imperial reverse types, if artistically less remarkable, are uniquely important for the unparalleled fullness of the historical commentary that they supply. The major mints provided annual evidence of imperial interests: victories in war; frontier defense (e.g., *Rex Parthis datus* —“A king is given to the Parthians”—of Trajan); a well-earned peace (e.g., the *Pace terra marique parta Ianum clusit* —“There being peace on land and sea, the doors of the Temple of Janus were closed”—of Nero); the birth of an heir or alternative provision for the succession; public shows; acts of social reform or public relief (e.g., *Civitatibus Asiae restitutis* —“For the restitution of the citizenries of Asia”); imperial journeys (e.g., *Adventus Augusti* —“The arrival of the emperor”); and religious or other anniversaries (e.g., the *Felix temporum reparatio* —“Happy days are here again”—on Rome’s 1,100th birthday). Their interpretation demands care, since, being selected by imperial officials, their tenor can conflict with the attitude of anti-imperial historians. But they show the efforts made by emperors, as the omnipotent semireligious heads of a huge and heterogeneous empire, to conciliate and inform. They contributed powerfully to the growing conception of an eternal Roman empire, seen no less in the special types of eagle (the soul flown heavenward) or funeral pyre or temple in honour of “good” emperors consecrated as *divi* than in the annual record of military victory, economic security, and provincial peace and implicit in the regularity of imperial succession. The normal colour given to this imperial program was religious, for the coinage types commonly embraced such characteristically Roman concepts as Aequitas (Justice), Fides (Faith), and Concordia (Harmony)—social virtues operating in the guise of minor deities.

### The 4th century and after

[Diocletian](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Diocletian) ’s institution of the [tetrarchy](https://www.britannica.com/topic/tetrarch-ancient-Greek-official), by which the empire was divided administratively between two Augusti and two Caesars, brought fundamental changes in social and economic policy; the instability of prices called for complete renewal of the monetary system. His coinage reforms took place in stages from about 286 to about 296. First, new aurei were struck at 60 to the pound of gold. Then, about 293–294, new silver coins, of good purity, were struck at the revised Neronian weight of 96 to the pound of silver. Finally, about 294–296, new copper coins appeared that were larger and intrinsically more valuable than the small debased double denarii of previous reigns. The contemporary names of these silver and copper pieces are not known. This reformed coinage was struck at a variety of mints from Londinium (London) to Alexandria, most of which coined in all three metals. Types were closely controlled in the silver and copper coinage; in the latter the almost universal type was for some years that of the “Genius Populi Romani.” The obverse bore the portrait of one or other of the tetrarchs, each of whom coined with portraits of all four.

The breakdown of the tetrarchy after 306 weakened the new system. Copper was quickly and steadily lightened, and silver struck very sparingly. Gold, however, continued in good supply; and though Constantine’s solidus showed a reduced weight standard, there was no shortage of gold throughout the rest of the 4th century. In time, silver coinage increased, especially after about 350, when the miliarense (1/1,000 of a gold pound) and smaller denominations appeared. By the end of the 4th century, however, the size of copper coins had dropped very sharply, and in the 5th, until the Western Empire collapsed in ad 476, the western coinage consisted finally of gold with a little silver, struck mainly from the mints of Ravenna and Rome.

From 312, when [Constantine](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Constantine-I-Roman-emperor) became emperor of the West, coin types began to show new tendencies. The imperial portrait was still the dominant feature. Reverses displayed complementary themes—the glory of the army, vows for continued imperial rule, the constant struggle against barbarian pressure on the frontiers. The old variety of pagan gods—Jupiter excepted—mainly disappeared, though Sol, popular from Aurelian onward, was used, especially by Constantine. Christian emblems did little to take their place, though the Christian monogram, the Greek letters chi and rho superimposed, sometimes on a standard, began to appear with Constantine and was combined with the alpha and omega under [Constantius II](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Constantius-II) and Magnentius. On the whole, however, there was an unavowed truce between Christianity and paganism, only occasionally broken, as when Julian revived a range of pagan types; the full development of the Christian tradition in coinage was reserved for Byzantium.

## Coinage in western continental Europe, Africa, and the Byzantine Empire

The fall of Roman power in the West left the [gold](https://www.britannica.com/science/gold-chemical-element) [currency](https://www.britannica.com/money/currency) of the Byzantine Empire undisturbed; it was to become the most dominant single influence in European [coinage](https://www.britannica.com/money/coinage) for 1,000 years, competing at first with the gold of the Arab caliphates and later with that of the great Italian commercial republics as well. Byzantine coinage, in its continuity, contrasted strongly with the often erratic monetary systems from the 5th to the 7th century in western Europe, where Germanic invaders inherited the apparatus, [money](https://www.britannica.com/money/money) included, of the Roman Empire. In general, they took over the main features of late Roman coinage. Emphasis on gold continued, with [silver](https://www.britannica.com/science/silver) and some bronze; gold chiefly served for the triens, or third (1 / 3 of the Constantinian solidus). The types of the gold coins for some time reflected Byzantine prestige, showing a formalized portrait obverse and titles of the reigning Byzantine emperor, toward whom widespread respect was paid even when Western kings began to add their personal monograms to the normal Victory reverses. Imperial prerogative, so powerful an influence on western gold, had less effect on silver, the types of which in the West became more flexible; in bronze, where obvious efforts were at times made to link with traditional Roman design, flexibility was greater still. In technique these coinages varied widely: that of Italy was not without elegance; that of Spain developed an elaborately stylized balance, depending largely on its bold letter forms; the highly abstracted figures of Gallic coins have found great favour among 20th-century artists, while those of Africa and Britain were in general considered artistically inferior. The weights of gold coinages were kept at a reasonably steady level, though fineness ultimately declined with the economic decline of the issuing kingdoms themselves.

### Post-Roman coinage in the West

In Italy [Odoacer](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Odoacer) (476–493) had coined in silver and bronze at Ravenna after setting up a Teutonic kingdom. The [Ostrogothic](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Ostrogoth) coinage that followed, from [Theodoric](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Theodoric-king-of-Italy) (493–526) onward, consisted of gold, mainly imitating current Byzantine issues and with the imperial portrait (Theodoric’s fine portrait on a unique triple solidus is wholly exceptional). Silver and bronze were supplementary. The [Lombards](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Lombard-people) of Italy (568–774) had no distinctive coinage of their own until the gold struck in the name of [Grimoald](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Grimoald-duke-of-Benevento), duke of Beneventum (662–671), which was followed by gold and silver from a number of mints elsewhere. In Africa the [Vandal](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Vandal-Germanic-people) kings Gunthamund (484–496) and [Hilderic](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Hilderich) (523–?530) issued silver and bronze coinage, respectively, inscribed with their names; the types and denominations looked to imperial models and, in the case of the bronze, to those of Carthage especially. Vandal gold was perhaps struck by [Gaiseric](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Gaiseric) (428–477) or Huneric (477–484) in the Byzantine emperor’s name, but in the absence of any royal monogram it cannot easily be attributed. The chief Spanish coinage was that of the [Visigoths](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Visigoth), who controlled southern Gaul also and—after Leovigild (568–586)—Suevia (modern Galicia), with its rich gold mines; hence the fact that of 79 Visigothic mints a high proportion was concentrated in northwestern Spain. Visigothic gold coinage was produced up to the Arab invasion in the 8th century and consisted almost entirely of thirds, at first imitating Byzantine models, and bearing kings’ names and titles. The most prolific mints were Mérida, Toledo, Sevilla, Tarragona, and Córdoba.

In [Gaul](https://www.britannica.com/place/Gaul-ancient-region-Europe) the [Burgundians](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Burgundian) struck their own imitative gold thirds, first, under [Gundobad](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Gundobad) (473–516), inscribed with a royal monogram, though not yet displacing the imperial name and portrait. The largest of the Gaulish coinages, however, was that of the [Merovingian](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Merovingian-dynasty) [Franks](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Frank-people), beginning with [Clovis I](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Clovis-I) (481–511). The gold consisted mainly of thirds, at first with some subsidiary silver and [copper](https://www.britannica.com/science/copper), inscribed by [Theodoric I](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Theodoric-I-king-of-Reims) (511–533/534) and [Childebert I](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Childebert-I) of Paris (511–558) with their own names. As elsewhere, the types of the gold borrowed steadily from the imperial series, either the former Roman or the current Byzantine. Reverses showed a Victory, though the theme of the “cross on steps” of [Tiberius II](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Tiberius-II-Constantinus) (578–582) gradually displaced it, beginning in the south. Obverses generally showed a profile, and later sometimes a frontal, bust. A profound break with tradition came when [Theodebert I](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Theodebert-I) (533/534–547/548) substituted his own name on his gold for that of the Byzantine emperor—a change that in turn was to influence Visigothic gold. The right of striking gold had meanwhile been widely extended, to mints presumably operated by royal permission and numbering nearly 500 in all. These were distributed over an area including not only what is now France but also the [Low Countries](https://www.britannica.com/place/Low-Countries), the Rhineland, and [Switzerland](https://www.britannica.com/place/Switzerland). The types of Merovingian gold coins diverged increasingly from imperial models: nearly all of them were inscribed on the obverse with the name of the issuing authority, most often municipal, and on the reverse with that of the moneyer. As the Merovingian dynasty drew to a close in the 8th century, gold coinage became poorer in quality, and it gave way to the small silver denarius, of about 1.2 grams, struck in quantity. This change heralded the Carolingian revival of the denarius.

Coinage supply to Britain was interrupted when the mints of Roman Gaul were closed about 395, and scarcely any gold or silver coin entered Britain during about 450–550. Subsequent penetration of Merovingian gold encouraged a brief Anglo-Saxon coinage of gold thirds (*see below* [Early Anglo-Saxon coins](https://www.britannica.com/money/coin/Coins-of-the-British-Isles-colonies-and-Commonwealth#ref16001)).

### Coinage in the Byzantine Empire

Inspiring many features of these transient coinages, but outliving them all, stood the [currency](https://www.britannica.com/money/currency) of the [Byzantine Empire](https://www.britannica.com/place/Byzantine-Empire). It was based on the [gold](https://www.britannica.com/science/gold-chemical-element) [solidus](https://www.britannica.com/topic/solidus-Byzantine-coin) (1 / 72 of a pound) of Constantine—the bezant of 4.5 grams (about 70 grains) maximum, which dominated so much of European trade to the 13th century. Until the 10th century, halves and thirds were also used. This gold was proverbial for its purity until the 10th century. The fundamentally religious nature of the empire was fully reflected in the coinage: throughout 10 centuries there was scarcely a single issue that did not look directly to the [Christian](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Christianity) faith, since apart from reverse types and legends, which were purely religious, the obverses showed the emperors as specifically Christian rulers by the use of adjuncts or appropriate inscriptions.

Basil I, coin, 9th century; in the British Museum.

Byzantine [coinage](https://www.britannica.com/money/coinage) began effectively with the reign (491–518) of [Anastasius I](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Anastasius-I). Thenceforth, it consisted, in addition to gold, of [silver](https://www.britannica.com/science/silver) and bronze. Silver, always rather rare, consisted of the small siliqua (1 / 24 of a solidus) or keration, followed by the larger miliaresion and the still larger hexagram. Bronze was in most periods very commonly struck. Its appearance and tariffing were reformed by Anastasius, who issued large pieces marked *M, K, I,* and *E* (equal to 40, 20, 10, and five *nummi*); other multiples were found either later or locally, as *IB* (equal to 12 *nummi*) at Alexandria. Such marks of value continued until [Basil I](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Basil-I-Byzantine-emperor) (867–886). Constantinople itself was the main [mint](https://www.britannica.com/money/mint-metallurgy) in all three metals, which were coined also at Carthage and Ravenna. Thessalonica, Nicomedia, Cyzicus, Antioch, and Alexandria struck bronze only; at one time or another Rome struck gold and bronze, while Syracuse and Catana also contributed. The technique of gold and silver minting was generally high; that of bronze was coarse, and overstriking was common.

### Types and legends of Byzantine coins

For gold, the earliest obverses were diademed profile busts or helmeted facing busts, both common on previous coins of eastern and western empires. The facing bust showed the emperor in military panoply with a cross in his hand or on his helmet, and, if the cross was lacking on the obverse, it appeared on the reverse. With [Justin I](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Justin-I) (518–527) and [Justinian I](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Justinian-I) (527–565), the seated figures of the emperors were shown side by side (527). Thereafter, the facing head became more common: from the time of [Phocas](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Phocas) (602–610) it was increasingly formalized, a process that reached its climax in the 8th century. Under [Heraclius](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Heraclius-Byzantine-emperor) (610–641) the habit began of showing the emperor with one or more of his sons; and, with figure types now more common, it was possible to show emperor and empress together or even, as with [John I Tzimisces](https://www.britannica.com/biography/John-I-Tzimisces) (969–976), the emperor being crowned by the Virgin, with the hand of God above. The reverses of the gold coins at first emphasized the Victory (doubtless regarded as an angel) of previous issues. Tiberius II introduced the cross potent on steps, a type destined to play a long and important part. [Justinian II](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Justinian-II) (685–711) was the first to use the haloed bust of Christ, who had previously been shown only on a coin of about 450, in the act of marrying the empress Pulcheria to Marcian. The Iconoclasm of [Leo III](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Leo-III) (717–741) and his successors banished such divine representations in favour either of the cross on steps or of imperial figures on the reverses, but with [Michael III](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Michael-III-Byzantine-emperor) (842–867) the bust of Christ returned. From Basil I the throned Christ predominated.

The obverses of the silver coins, beginning with profile busts, thereafter included seated figures, facing busts, and purely epigraphic designs. The introduction of the larger hexagram by Heraclius in 615 allowed fuller scope for later designers, whose reverses often consisted of a cross on steps or a bust of Christ surrounded by inscriptions; from the 10th century the cross bore a central portrait medallion of the emperor himself.

In bronze coinage there was at first less flexibility. The earliest types were, obverse, a profile bust and, reverse, a cross and [mark](https://www.britannica.com/money/mark-German-currency) of value. Under Justinian I the facing bust prevailed, and in his 12th year he introduced the dating of his bronze coins on the reverse, in the form *Anno XII;* the inclusion of a regnal date was thereafter normal on bronze until [Constans II](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Constans-II-Pogonatus) (641–668). From the time of [Justin II](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Justin-II) (565–578) the obverses showed two or more standing imperial figures combined (until Basil I) with the mark of value. From the 10th century the reverses were taken up wholly by three or four lines of inscription; and the anonymous bronze coins of John Tzimisces combined such a reverse, reading *Iesus Christus Basileu* (*s*) *Basile* (*on*), with a new obverse showing the facing bust of Christ designated *Emmanuel.*

The orthography of Byzantine coin legends became remarkably complex as the Latin and Greek alphabets were increasingly mingled and individual letters took on new or specialized forms and words were severely abbreviated. At first the inscriptions were purely Latin, the emperor’s names and titles being in the conventional form *D* (*ominus*) *N* (*oster*) *—P* (*ius*) *F* (*elix*) *Aug* (*ustus*). Even before Anastasius, however, *Perpetuus* had been a variant for *P.F.*, and, abbreviated in the form *PP*, it finally prevailed. In the 7th century, Greek letters were more commonly mixed with the Latin in such legends as that of Justinian II, when he styled himself *Servus Christi;* and in the later 8th, the general shift to Greek from Latin conceptions was plain in the emperor’s new title of *Basileus.* Comparatively long votive inscriptions, as “Lord, help thy servant,” and metrical inscriptions (a practice more common in Asia than in Europe) began in the 10th century.

### Economic role of Byzantine coins

Byzantine gold coinage, until its debasement from the 10th century, was immensely important in the economic life of the Levant and western Mediterranean. The total output of gold was great, and its influence can be judged partly from the distribution of the coins themselves and partly by the typological influence exerted by the Byzantine upon other coinages, from the first Arab-Sāsānian gold of the East to that of Italy and Gaul in the West. In the 5th and 6th centuries, Byzantine solidi accumulated in the Baltic area, doubtless in payment for furs; and, in the 6th and 7th, solidi of a slightly lighter weight were hoarded in France, the [Low Countries](https://www.britannica.com/place/Low-Countries), Scandinavia, Germany, the Balkans, Russia, the Levant, and northern Africa. In these last two regions Byzantine gold competed from the 7th century with the increasing output of Arab gold dinars.

### Charlemagne and the Carolingian coinages

While the bezant and [dinar](https://www.britannica.com/money/dinar-currency) maintained [gold](https://www.britannica.com/science/gold-chemical-element) [currency](https://www.britannica.com/money/currency) along the Mediterranean, northern Europe from the 8th century suffered a shortage of gold and turned its almost exclusive attention to [silver](https://www.britannica.com/science/silver), inherently more convenient as a unit of exchange. A previous Merovingian tendency to introduce silver alongside gold was carried much further when the Carolingian ruler [Pippin III the Short](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Pippin-III) (751–768) replaced gold by silver, introducing the denier, which was to be the basis of all medieval [coinage](https://www.britannica.com/money/coinage) in the north. His new coin was wider and thinner than previous silver pieces. The normal types were simple—obverse *R P* (for *Rex Pepinus*), reverse *R F* (for *Rex Francorum*).

Charlemagne (768–814) reorganized northern currency in a way that affected it permanently. Coining at first simply as *Carolus R F,* he defeated the Lombards in 774 and entered Rome, becoming king of Lombardy as well. His deniers were later made wider and still heavier (about 25 grains), and he introduced the smaller and subsidiary obole, or half-denier. The main types of his deniers were threefold: the monogram of his Latinized name, Carolus; a temple (sometimes a gateway); and, more rarely, a portrait. Monogram deniers were coined in France, Germany, northern Italy, and northeastern Spain; temple deniers were also widely struck, often inscribed *XRISTIANA RELIGIO,* though this legend was sometimes replaced by the name of a major French [mint](https://www.britannica.com/money/mint-metallurgy) city. On Christmas Day 800, Pope [Leo III](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Leo-III) crowned Charlemagne as Roman emperor, and, thenceforth, his deniers, either with the temple type and “Christian” legend or with a mint name alone, styled him *Kar* (*o*) *lus Imp. Aug.,* sometimes adding *Rex F* (*rancorum*) *et L* (*angobardorum*). His mints lay mainly in France, the Rhineland, and the [Low Countries](https://www.britannica.com/place/Low-Countries).

[Louis I](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Louis-I-Holy-Roman-emperor) (814–840) continued his father’s monetary system with little essential change. But the infringement of his minting rights emphasized the economic importance of northern ports, especially the Frisian Duurstede, from the neighbourhood of which emanated large numbers of copies of his gold sous and half-sous. These portrait coins originally were designed presumably for presentation to the [Holy See](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Holy-See), since the reverse bore the inscription *MVNVS DIVINVM* around a cross. They were struck sparingly, and no Carolingian gold thereafter appeared. Charlemagne’s pattern of coinage, sometimes varied, was extended to [Lotharingia](https://www.britannica.com/place/Lorraine-historical-region-Europe), with such powerful mints as Cologne, Metz, Trier, and Strasbourg. From the time of the French kings [Louis II](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Louis-II-king-of-France) and [III](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Louis-III-Holy-Roman-emperor) (877–882) the Carolingian currency pattern weakened, and feudal coinages made their first appearances. [Louis IV](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Louis-IV-king-of-France) d’Outremer granted coinage rights to the archbishop of Reims as early as 850, and the system was swiftly developed in the 10th century, concessions being made to a large number of ecclesiastical foundations and even in a few cases to lay lords as well. In Spain, Carolingian mints were established only in the extreme northeast, at Barcelona, Ampurias, and Gerona. The kingdom of [Aquitaine](https://www.britannica.com/place/Aquitaine), under Charlemagne, was reserved to the Frankish king’s son, and its coins were modeled on the Carolingian pattern. Northern Italy was an integral part of the territories controlled by the earlier Carolingians, but from the mid-9th century changes began to show: the deniers of Pavia and Milan, though retaining Carolingian types, became broader and thinner, with wide rims like those of the later German bracteates (*see below* [Italy and Sicily](https://www.britannica.com/money/coin/Switzerland#ref15992)). Venice, a republic from the late 7th century, ruled by a doge under Byzantine protection, did not coin until the 9th, when it struck deniers for the Carolingians; but after [Lothar I](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Lothar-I) it omitted mention of the imperial name. At Rome [papal](https://www.britannica.com/topic/papacy) coinage began with [Adrian I](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Adrian-I) (772–795), Byzantine in style and types, but after Charlemagne’s visit in 774 all deniers (except during an imperial interregnum) were struck jointly with the pope’s monogram and the emperor’s name, until 904; thenceforth, the papal name appeared in full and alone. The principalities of Beneventum and Salerno and the duchies of Naples and Amalfi fell within the Byzantine–Arab orbit, and their gold, silver, and bronze showed these beside Carolingian influences; bronze coins in particular followed Byzantine models, while the gold tari of Salerno were curious fractional copies of Arab dinars. In central Europe, Carolingian coinage was not reflected east of the Rhineland, but in the north the imitation of Carolingian [money](https://www.britannica.com/money/money) in or around Duurstede bred more distantly derivative issues elsewhere, possibly even in Scandinavia; these were, in effect, silver deniers, but their types, with their emphasis on ships and animal designs, show them to belong to the Nordic, as opposed to the Teutonic, stream of monetary design.

## The later medieval and modern coinages of continental Europe

The change of power from Frankish to German emperors in the 10th century saw the silver denier extended into central and northern Europe. In the East the decay of the [Byzantine Empire](https://www.britannica.com/place/Byzantine-Empire) was reflected in the debasement of its gold coinage to [electrum](https://www.britannica.com/science/electrum); after the temporary fall of Constantinople to Western crusaders in 1204, Byzantine tradition was carried on in the silver coinages of the derivative empires of Trebizond, Nicaea, and elsewhere. The revival of gold coinage in Italy in the 13th and 14th centuries, promptly copied elsewhere, led to the need for a silver denomination larger than the denier, and the grosso and its equivalents soon spread widely. From the 14th century coinage began to lose its Gothic stiffness: the Italian [Renaissance](https://www.britannica.com/event/Renaissance) pointed the way to naturalism in portraiture and to greater fluency of ornament. In the 15th century the first experiments were made with mechanical methods of coining, and by the 16th the new techniques were being generally adopted (*see below* [Techniques of production](https://www.britannica.com/money/coin/Coins-of-Africa#ref16102)). The traditionally privileged nonregal mints were incapable of producing the mechanical power needed for the intensive coinage not only of the large gold denominations resulting from the influx of Spanish-American treasure after 1493 but also with the equally large silver thalers, or dollars, beginning to be produced with silver from the German Joachimsthal mines. Multiplication of gold and silver coinages, and their larger denominational values, emphasized the need for token coinages, which were produced from the 17th century. Britain was effectively on the [gold standard](https://www.britannica.com/money/gold-standard) from the end of the 18th century, together with Portugal, but it was not until the second half of the 19th that continental Europe followed suit. Paper currencies of this period were fully redeemable in gold coin, but the gold standard was abandoned during World War I; since then, paper has been redeemable effectively only in base-metal alloys.

The coin types of the later medieval period were relatively crude. Portraiture, schematically stiff on later Byzantine money, was revived with striking realism most notably in Renaissance Italy and thereafter flourished. Reverses revealed feudal influence in shields of arms and civic emblems. These developments set the general pattern of modern coinage, usually with an obverse portrait and some form of national badge or arms on the reverse. From about 1800 onward this pattern was standardized to a large degree.

### Portugal

Coinage began in Portugal, after the expulsion of the Moors, with [Afonso I](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Afonso-I-king-of-Portugal) (1128–85), whose [gold](https://www.britannica.com/science/gold-chemical-element) maravedis, copied from the gold of the Berber Almoravids, retained certain Arab features in design. Some base silver was also struck. Rights of [coinage](https://www.britannica.com/money/coinage) were, from the start, reserved to the kings, almost exclusively. [Peter I](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Peter-I-king-of-Portugal) (1357–67) reformed the coinage on the basis of the gold dobra of about 4.9 grams, with types copied from those of contemporary France: obverse, king enthroned; reverse, ornamental cross. There was a similarly imitative silver [gros tournois](https://www.britannica.com/topic/gros-tournois) (based on the weight standard of Tours, Fr.). Peter’s successors developed his system. Copper was struck from the 15th century. From the 16th to the 18th century, gold was coined in quantity and in denominations of handsome size down to the half-escudo. In the 19th century the basic gold denomination was the [crown](https://www.britannica.com/money/crown-monetary-unit). In the 20th century token denominations (in terms of centavos) have prevailed in various alloys, though silver was introduced in 1954 for the 10-escudo piece and for certain purely commemorative issues.

### Spain

As in Portugal, the coinage struck after the expulsion of the Moors was almost without exception regal. That of [Navarre](https://www.britannica.com/place/Navarra) started under [Sancho III Garcés](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Sancho-III-Garces) (*c.* 1000–35) with deniers of Carolingian influence. The series of [Castile](https://www.britannica.com/place/Castile-region-Spain) and [León](https://www.britannica.com/place/Leon-medieval-kingdom-Spain) began with similar pieces under [Alfonso VI](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Alfonso-VI) (1065–1109), and that of [Aragon](https://www.britannica.com/place/Kingdom-of-Aragon) under [Sancho Ramírez](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Sancho-Ramirez) (1063–94). Among the earliest gold was that of [Alfonso VIII](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Alfonso-VIII) of Castile (1158–1214), copying an Arab gold [dinar](https://www.britannica.com/money/dinar-currency) but with Christian professions in its Arabic script. Gold portrait doblas appeared under [Sancho IV](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Sancho-IV-king-of-Castile-and-Leon) of [Castile and León](https://www.britannica.com/place/Castile-Leon) in the 13th century, and the portraiture under [Pedro I](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Peter-king-of-Castile-and-Leon) in the 14th was of high quality. Gold coinage multiplied in the 15th century, with [Henry IV](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Henry-IV-king-of-Castile) coining huge pieces of superb Gothic style; silver and billon were also in good supply. The union of the crowns of Castile and Aragon in 1479, and subsequently the influx of American precious metals, resulted in an abundant coinage in gold (the excelente and its multiples) and silver (the real and its multiples)—the silver piece of eight being the famous Spanish [dollar](https://www.britannica.com/money/dollar). This last denomination enjoyed enormously wide [currency](https://www.britannica.com/money/currency), and its type (obverse, royal portrait; reverse, [Pillars of Hercules](https://www.britannica.com/place/Pillars-of-Heracles) with *PLVS* *VLTRA* on scroll) was universally known.

### France

The [dynasty](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Capetian-dynasty) of [Hugh Capet](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Hugh-Capet) (987–996) made no immediate change in the previous Carolingian coinage system: deniers and their halves, the oboles, continued, but tended to decline in fineness. Feudal deniers began to appear in abundance beyond Capet’s kingdom of north central France; the most important and numerous were issued from the 10th century by the abbey of St. Martin at Tours, with a “castle” type destined to exert wide influence. This monnaie tournois was lighter than the royal monnaie parisis (based on the Paris weight standard), generally in the ratio 4:5. [Louis IX](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Louis-IX) in and after 1262 reformed the coinage. The sou became in 1266 the silver gros tournois, 23 / 24 fine and weighing about four grams; its types continued the “castle” of the denier tournois but with concentric inscription and ornament frequently imitated. With this there appeared a gold écu, with the royal lilies on a shield. Subsequent development down to the 15th century emphasized more and larger gold denominations; silver continued, often debased. Design reached magnificent heights of Gothic splendour, seen in the *masse d’or* (“sceptre of gold”), *mouton d’or* (“Paschal Lamb”), *ange d’or* (“angel of gold”), and *franc d’or* (franc \[“free”\], a term first applied to a coin of John II, minted in 1360 to commemorate his ransom from the English). The Anglo-Gallic issues of the time were comparably beautiful. Feudal coinage was severely limited, that of Brittany and (at first) Aquitaine being most important. Types in Aquitaine later showed some English influence, while in the gold of Provence that of the Florentine florin was noticeable. In the 16th century broad, thick silver coins were adopted, familiarized by the testons (from *testone,* which means “head”) of Italy; these, together with the gold écus, set the general pattern.

Early in the 17th century the use of machinery for coining was the subject of experiments by [Nicolas Briot](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Nicolas-Briot); both he and [Jean Warin](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Jean-Warin) were famous for their technique and style under [Louis XIII](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Louis-XIII). The late 17th and 18th centuries, though their coinage was of considerable external magnificence, were not devoid of monetary difficulty. [Louis XV](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Louis-XV) suppressed independent local minting, Strasbourg being the last provincial [mint](https://www.britannica.com/money/mint-metallurgy) to survive, though royal branch mints continued. Under the Revolution [Louis XVI](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Louis-XVI) coined first as constitutional king, in gold, [silver](https://www.britannica.com/science/silver), and [copper](https://www.britannica.com/science/copper); but from 1793 the issues were wholly republican, with the inscriptions *République français, Liberté,* etc., and the symbols (cap of liberty, cock) that have survived in modern French coinage. The precious metals were in short supply; gold and silver were demonetized and paper took their place, together with copper. In 1793 the [decimal system](https://www.britannica.com/science/decimal) was adopted, in terms of francs, decimes, and centimes, coins now being dated by the [Revolutionary](https://www.britannica.com/event/French-Revolution) era; gold coinage was effectively lacking until the time of Napoleon. From 1866 France was joined with Belgium, Italy, and [Switzerland](https://www.britannica.com/place/Switzerland) in a monetary convention defining the denominations, quality, and weight of gold and silver coinage in terms of francs. In the 20th century alloys were introduced, and the [Vichy](https://www.britannica.com/event/Vichy-France) government of Henri-Philippe Pétain also used zinc, iron, and aluminum. From 1950 paper [money](https://www.britannica.com/money/money) was increasingly replaced by [alloy](https://www.britannica.com/technology/alloy) coins, the “heavy” revalued [franc](https://www.britannica.com/money/franc) being introduced in 1959.

### The Low Countries

In Merovingian and Carolingian periods a few mints operated in the Low Countries. Subsequently the area was divided among a number of dukes, counts, seigneurs, and ecclesiastics. In the 16th century the Low Countries passed to the [House of Austria](https://www.britannica.com/topic/House-of-Habsburg), and the daalder (dollar) appeared. English military operations were accompanied by the issue of gold pieces. The 16th century produced some remarkable siege pieces from Amsterdam, [Bergen op Zoom](https://www.britannica.com/place/Bergen-op-Zoom), and elsewhere. With the establishment of the Kingdom of Holland under Louis Napoleon in 1806, coinage began to conform with that of the Napoleonic empire. Belgium emerged as an independent kingdom in 1831, and in 1860 adopted a [cupronickel](https://www.britannica.com/technology/cupronickel) alloy for its French- or Flemish-inscribed or bilingual coinage.

### Switzerland

The [coinage](https://www.britannica.com/money/coinage) of Switzerland illustrates its varying fortunes. First there was the [gold](https://www.britannica.com/science/gold-chemical-element) [money](https://www.britannica.com/money/money) of the Merovingian kings, among whose mints were Basel, Lausanne, Saint-Maurice-en-Valais, and Sitten (Sion). The [silver](https://www.britannica.com/science/silver) deniers that Charlemagne made the coinage of the empire were issued by fewer mints. The dukes of Swabia began to strike at Zürich in the 10th century, and the empire from the 10th to the 13th century granted the right of coinage to various ecclesiastical foundations. Bern was allowed a [mint](https://www.britannica.com/money/mint-metallurgy) by the emperor Frederick II in 1218, and other towns and seigneurs subsequently gained the same right. The demi- [bracteate](https://www.britannica.com/topic/bracteate-coin) appeared about the middle of the 11th century, and about 1125 it was superseded by the true bracteate, which lasted until about 1300. (Bracteates were lightweight silver coins so thin that they bore only a single type, repoussé \[hammered into relief on the reverse\], for which a special technique \[including the use of wooden dies\] was devised.) The Swiss Confederation developed in the 14th century, and by degrees the cantons struck their own money. These, together with the coins of some few sees and abbacies, formed the bulk of Swiss money of the medieval and modern periods. The cantonal coinage, interrupted by the French occupation, was suppressed in 1848, when a uniform [currency](https://www.britannica.com/money/currency) was adopted.

### Italy and Sicily

At the close of the Carolingian period the coinage of Italy fell into two main classes. In nearly all of the north, including Rome, it consisted of silver deniers of Carolingian derivation, mainly struck at Pavia, Milan, Lucca, and Verona. At Venice and over most of the south the dual influences of the Byzantine and Arab empires were prominent. Monetary fashions were shown in the coinage of Sicily struck by the Normans. [Robert Guiscard](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Robert-duke-of-Apulia) in 1075–85 struck small gold coins called taris of almost wholly Arabic appearance, together with bronze of Byzantine style. [Roger I](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Roger-I) of Sicily Latinized the bronze, and [Roger II](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Roger-II) coined silver ducats of Byzantine type; Arab-style gold taris still continued for commercial reasons, since the great Fāṭimid coinage was then the currency of all western Muslims. After southern Italy and Sicily had fallen to German power, [Frederick II](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Frederick-II-Holy-Roman-emperor) (1212–50) restored a Latin coinage of gold, of splendid style and execution and good fineness, in proto-Renaissance style. His gold augustale (patterned after the aureus) and their halves, struck about 1231 at Brindisi and Messina, were accompanied by billon deniers. Sicily soon passed to [Charles I](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Charles-I-king-of-Naples-and-Sicily) of Anjou (1266–85), and its Angevin coinage, like that of Naples, assumed the French medieval style, succeeded in turn by that of the Aragonese kings.

In northern Italy leading cities were issuing silver with a free choice of types—portraits, badges, or figures of patron saints and others, with explanatory legends. Mantua celebrated Virgil; Florence from about 1189 showed its lily with [St. John](https://www.britannica.com/place/St-Johns-Newfoundland-and-Labrador) the Baptist; and Genoa chose the *janua,* or eponymous gate. [Venice](https://www.britannica.com/place/Venice), abandoning the imperial name early in the 12th century, set a precedent about 1192 in the issue of the larger silver [grosso](https://www.britannica.com/topic/grosso) or matapan, using the henceforth familiar types of Christ on the reverse and, obverse, St. Mark presenting the gonfalon (the banner of the republic) to the doge. The influence of the gold coinage of Frederick II on such cities was soon evident. Genoa was striking gold as early as 1252. Florence issued the first of its famous and profuse series of fiorini d’oro, or gold florins. The lily continued as the civic type, together with the standing figure of the Baptist. Regular weight (about 3.50 grams, 54 grains) and fineness [won](https://www.britannica.com/money/won) the fiorino universal fame and wide imitation; double florins were introduced in 1504. Venice in 1284 produced its gold [ducat](https://www.britannica.com/topic/ducat), or zecchino (sequin), of the same weight. Venetian ducats rivaled Florentine florins in commercial influence and were widely copied abroad. The series begun under Giovanni Dandolo continued with the names of the successive doges until the early 19th century.

At Rome no [papal](https://www.britannica.com/topic/papacy) coins appeared from 984 until purely epigraphic types recorded the names of Leo IX and the emperor Henry III in 1049–54. Thereafter, there was a further gap until Urban V (1362–70). The Senate of Rome coined silver deniers from 1188, with the antique legend *Senatus Populus Q.R.* and figures of SS. Peter and Paul. In 1252 Brancaleone struck deniers with the seated figure of Rome and the legend *Roma Caput Mundi;* Charles of Anjou in the 13th century and Cola di Rienzo in the 14th also coined, as Roman senator and tribune, respectively. Senatorial gold ducats were introduced on the Venetian model in 1350. Papal coinage returned from Avignon in 1367 with [Urban V](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Blessed-Urban-V), who assumed rights over the mint of Rome; gold, silver, and bronze later developed, with types (crossed keys, tiara, personal arms, and many different emblems) that, with few interruptions, have lasted ever since. Since 1869 papal coinage has been mainly of a commemorative nature, in silver, acmonital (stainless steel), and bronze, of denominations corresponding with the Italian state coinage.

The [patronage](https://www.britannica.com/art/patronage-art) given by the popes to notable artists—e.g., Francia and Benvenuto Cellini—resulted in a fine and often lavish standard of design in their coins and medals. Similar patronage was shown by the noble houses of Ferrara, Mantua, Milan, and elsewhere, whose coinages from the 15th century attained a splendid level. The size of gold and silver denominations was growing, as witness the silver [teston](https://www.britannica.com/money/shilling) of 1472; and the portraits made by Caradosso, Francia, and others of equal fame are among the finest small-scale Renaissance works. Later coins of still larger size of the duchies of Savoy and Florence are remarkable. Italian coinage continued to be divided among a number of kingdoms, principalities, and duchies until 1861, when [Victor Emmanuel I](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Victor-Emmanuel-I) first coined as king of all Italy. The metals were gold, silver, and bronze; alloys were introduced under [Umberto I](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Umberto-I) (1878–1900). Under [Victor Emmanuel III](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Victor-Emmanuel-III) (1900–46) reverse types borrowed heavily from the antique, and his later issues reflected the influence of the Fascist regime, being dated by the Fascist era from 1936 (year XIV) as well as by the Christian. From that same year, he appeared as emperor (of Ethiopia) as well as king of Italy, and after 1939 coins were struck for him, with a helmeted portrait, as king of Albania. After [World War II](https://www.britannica.com/event/World-War-II) the republican coinage of Italy, in aluminum and steel, concentrated mainly on symbols of agricultural fertility and national industry.

### Germany and central Europe

Territorially, the German issues began and developed in an area that has since been many times divided and from which Austria, Hungary, Czechoslovakia, and Yugoslavia have emerged as separate states. Classification of these issues remains one of the most formidable numismatic problems.

From the 10th to the 12th century the Carolingian pattern of [coinage](https://www.britannica.com/money/coinage) was continued; but with the advent of the Swabians under Conrad III in 1138, unity disappeared. In the west the [silver](https://www.britannica.com/science/silver) denier continued. In the east the coinage of very thin bracteates was developed. The western deniers were in part from imperial mints, scattered among a much larger number of feudal mints, representing ecclesiastical rather than lay authorities. [Westphalia](https://www.britannica.com/place/Westphalia) produced a profuse ecclesiastical coinage. That of [Cologne](https://www.britannica.com/place/Cologne-Germany) was especially important, showing the former Carolingian “temple” combined with the linear inscription *S* (*ancta*) *Colonia A* (*grippinensis*); and that of Münster was comparable in influence. This area was conservative and prosperous; the weight of its deniers was well maintained, and, although Anglo-Saxon and, later, English and Byzantine influences became noticeable, its types changed but little.

In the eastern region a sharp decline in weight led to the thin, single-type bracteates, and the designs quickly broke away from Carolingian tradition. Issued by a wide variety of authorities, many of them ecclesiastical, these coins showed a great range of human figures and portraits (saintly and secular) together with representations of churches, castles, and heraldic devices in an essentially medieval Germanic style. The difference between the heavier western deniers and the lighter eastern bracteates was perhaps partly responsible for the emergence of the [Mark](https://www.britannica.com/money/mark-German-currency). This weight of solid silver, the mass of which varied from one time and area to another, stood at about 2 / 3 of the [gold](https://www.britannica.com/science/gold-chemical-element) pound, which equaled 240 western silver deniers.

Transition from medieval to modern coinage took place with the emperor [Louis IV](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Louis-IV-Holy-Roman-emperor) of Bavaria (1314–47), who introduced gold and multiplied the silver grossus already issued by Cologne under [Henry VII](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Henry-VII-Holy-Roman-emperor) (1308–13). Louis reduced the number of purely imperial mints. Many others operated by rights granted to the nobility, the churches, and certain municipalities, and from these henceforth appeared the bulk of German coinage, including from 1520 the large silver [thalers](https://www.britannica.com/topic/thaler) (so called from the Joachimsthal mines in Bohemia and from which derived the word *dollar*). In the 16th and 17th centuries the thalers and their multiples, of handsome and even ornate appearance, dominated the silver [currency](https://www.britannica.com/money/currency) of Germany. Thalers of Saxony and Brunswick are especially well known. The thaler continued as a unitary denomination to the 19th century in Germany proper, but in 1870 German adherence to the [gold standard](https://www.britannica.com/money/gold-standard) caused its abandonment. From 1870 the kings of Prussia as emperors coined for all Germany; henceforth, the innumerable local variations in coinage were subsumed under the gold Reichsmark of 100 pfennigs, the [silver standard](https://www.britannica.com/money/silver-standard) being abandoned. After [World War I](https://www.britannica.com/event/World-War-I) the rulers of German states abdicated or were deposed, and everywhere the value of the Mark declined to zero, its place being momentarily taken by inflated paper currencies. Silver was coined mainly for commemorative pieces between World Wars I and II, including the Hindenburg portrait pieces; zinc, aluminum, and alloys furnished the wartime currency of 1939–45. After 1948 the coins of [West Germany](https://www.britannica.com/place/West-Germany) were inscribed *Bundesrepublik Deutschland;* those of [East Germany](https://www.britannica.com/place/East-Germany), *Deutschland* alone (with emblems of industry and fertility).

In [Austria](https://www.britannica.com/place/Austria) there was a ducal silver coinage in the 11th century. It remained crude until the 14th century, when [Albert II](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Albert-II-duke-of-Austria) (1330–58) introduced a gold florin of Florentine character. The gros appeared with [Frederick III](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Frederick-III-Holy-Roman-emperor) (1440–93): thereafter, development was parallel with that of Germany, with thalers taking a prominent place. Those with the portrait of [Maria Theresa](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Maria-Theresa) acquired wide popularity on either side of the [Red Sea](https://www.britannica.com/place/Red-Sea). They continued to be coined in large numbers at Vienna and London, with the date 1780, for circulation in those regions: 24,000,000 were struck in 1940–41 from British mints alone.

The [Bohemian](https://www.britannica.com/place/Bohemia) ducal coinage of deniers from the 10th to the 12th century showed Byzantine, Scandinavian, and even English influences; by the 12th century the Prague [mint](https://www.britannica.com/money/mint-metallurgy) was developing its own style. [Wenceslas II](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Wenceslas-II) first produced the gros in 1300, and [John](https://www.britannica.com/biography/John-king-of-Bohemia) of Luxembourg (1310–46) the first gold florins, with, obverse, [crown](https://www.britannica.com/money/crown-monetary-unit) and, reverse, rampant lion. The regal coinage of [Hungary](https://www.britannica.com/place/Hungary) began with the deniers of [Stephen I](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Stephen-I-king-of-Hungary) (St. Stephen; 1000–38), and the style remained crude until [Charles I](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Charles-I-king-of-Hungary) (1310–42) introduced a lily-bearing gold florin and a silver gros modeled on those of Naples and Rome.

With the formation of the [Austro-Hungarian Empire](https://www.britannica.com/place/Austria-Hungary) in 1848, the coinage of the two countries, including Bohemia, was unified. During 1857–68 the coinage conformed to the terms of a monetary convention with Germany. The coins of Austria and Hungary were differentiated from 1868: the former were inscribed in German or Latin, and the latter in Magyar. Since 1923 the republican coinage of Austria has been conspicuous for its commemorative silver coins. That of Hungary, under the regency of Adm. [Miklós Horthy](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Miklos-Nagybanyai-Horthy), emphasized the crown of St. Stephen; under Soviet domination types symbolized revolution, peace, fertility, and industry, together with architectural motifs for silver.

[Czechoslovak](https://www.britannica.com/place/Czechoslovakia) coinage from its inception in 1918 had shown the lion of Bohemia; special coinages have commemorated St. Wenceslas (in gold) and [Tomáš Masaryk](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Tomas-Masaryk) and—after the Soviet occupation of 1968—Stalin (in silver). [Yugoslavia](https://www.britannica.com/place/Yugoslavia-former-federated-nation-1929-2003), similarly an offshoot of Austria-Hungary, has a currency based on paras and dinars. That of [Albania](https://www.britannica.com/place/Albania), until its domination by the [Soviet Union](https://www.britannica.com/place/Soviet-Union) in the early 1950s, drew heavily on classical Greek types.

### Scandinavia

The origin of Norwegian, Danish, and Swedish coinages is clearly the result of the Danish conquest of England. The Runic alphabet was employed, though not by any means exclusively, on many early coins of Denmark and [Norway](https://www.britannica.com/place/Norway). The Norwegian series began with [Haakon the Great](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Haakon-Sigurdsson) (*c.* 970–995), who copied the pennies of [Ethelred II](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Ethelred-the-Unready). In the second half of the 11th century, a coinage of small, thin pennies began, which developed into bracteates. [Magnus VI](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Magnus-VI) (1263–80) restored the coinage, more or less imitating the English sterlings of the time.

The [money](https://www.britannica.com/money/money) of Denmark began with pennies of [Sweyn I](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Sweyn-I) (*c.* 987–1014), also copied from the coinage of Ethelred II; the coins of [Canute](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Canute-I) (Cnut) the Great (1016–35) and [Hardecanute](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Hardecanute) (Harthacnut; reign extended to England in 1040–42) were mainly English in character.

With [Magnus I](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Magnus-I-Olafsson) (reign extended to Denmark in 1042–47) other influences, especially Byzantine, appeared, and the latter was very strong under [Sweyn II Estridsen](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Sweyn-II-Estridsen) (1047–74). Bracteates came in during the second half of the 12th century. The coinage is very difficult to classify until the time of Eric of Pomerania (1397). There were important episcopal coinages at Roskilde and Lund in the 12th and 13th centuries.

[Sweden](https://www.britannica.com/place/Sweden) had very few early coins; Swedish coinage began with imitations by Olaf Skötkonung (995) of English pennies and included the usual [bracteate](https://www.britannica.com/art/bracteate-jewelry) coinage. The money was restored by Albert of Mecklenburg (1364–89). The thaler was introduced by [Sten Sture](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Sten-Sture-the-Younger) the Younger (1512–20). The money of [Gustav II Adolf](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Gustav-II-Adolf) (1611–32) is historically interesting. Under [Charles XII](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Charles-XII) (1697–1718) there was highly curious money of necessity (i.e., a coinage struck to fulfill a need, usually in time of war and siege, but with inadequate technical means available). The small [copper](https://www.britannica.com/science/copper) daler was struck, sometimes plated; types included Roman divinities. During the 17th and 18th centuries there was a large issue of enormous plates of copper, stamped with their full value in silver money as a countermark.

Modern Norwegian coinage, like that of Denmark, is remarkable in including certain denominations pierced with a central hole. That of Sweden has included some large commemorative pieces of silver. In Denmark the Copenhagen mint has produced a colonial coinage for Greenland. [Iceland](https://www.britannica.com/place/Iceland), formerly joined with the Danish crown, has struck republican coins since 1944.

### Poland

After monetary beginnings derived from Germany, Poland developed a 16th-century [coinage](https://www.britannica.com/money/coinage) in [gold](https://www.britannica.com/science/gold-chemical-element), [silver](https://www.britannica.com/science/silver), and billon that reflected its status as the greatest power in eastern Europe; its thalers were especially remarkable for fine portraiture and decoration, including the superb pieces coined by Danzig (Gdańsk) after 1567, when this area sought Polish protection. Dismemberment of Poland in the 17th and 18th centuries was followed by fluctuations in status, which have continued ever since. The coinage of independence after [World War I](https://www.britannica.com/event/World-War-I) celebrated national symbolism and national heroes, such as [Józef Klemens Piłsudski](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Jozef-Pilsudski) and [John III Sobieski](https://www.britannica.com/biography/John-III-Sobieski). On the coins produced during German occupation in [World War II](https://www.britannica.com/event/World-War-II) and during Soviet control thereafter, the Polish eagle has been a prominent emblem. Danzig struck its own coinage (in pfennig and gulden) while a free city (1920–39).

### Russia and the Balkans

The earliest Russian coins were produced for the princes of Kiev in the 10th century and showed strong Byzantine influence. The staple coinage later came to consist of small silver [kopecks](https://www.britannica.com/topic/kopeck) and their halves (dengi) of Mongolian derivation. [Ivan IV](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Ivan-the-Terrible) (1547–84) standardized the types of the dengi as “Tsar and Grand Prince of All Russia,” showing a uniform design of a mounted lancer. From the 15th to the 17th century unstable social and economic conditions were reflected in clipping and counterfeiting, until reforms began in 1654. [Peter the Great](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Peter-the-Great) (1689–1725) reorganized the currency: gold was coined regularly from 1701, and silver rubles and billon kopecks also appeared, together with [copper](https://www.britannica.com/science/copper) fractions. In 1725, after Peter’s death, copper “plate money” was briefly produced (as in Scandinavia) at Ekaterinburg. Recoinage on a large scale occurred in 1741. Under [Catherine II](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Catherine-the-Great) (1762–96) copper rubles of great size were briefly struck, and substantial five-kopeck pieces were in common production; Russian copper was also produced in Georgia. In the 19th century, Russian coinage followed conventional lines apart from the short-lived introduction in 1828 of [platinum](https://www.britannica.com/science/platinum) for pieces of 3, 6, and 12 [rubles](https://www.britannica.com/money/ruble). The silver [ruble](https://www.britannica.com/money/ruble), however, remained the monetary basis, worth 100 kopecks until a change to gold in 1897. Soviet issues were mainly of alloys, with scarce silver and, very rarely, gold; types usually included the hammer and sickle and the star, together with allusions to industry and agriculture, though after the Revolution the Russian eagle was used at first.

[Finland](https://www.britannica.com/place/Finland), as a Russian grand duchy from 1809, struck in gold, silver, and bronze until declaring independence in 1917; since then, its coins have shown the Finnish lion. Latvia coined as an independent state from 1918 to 1940 and again from 1992; Lithuanian independence, similarly until 1940 and again from 1992, was reflected in autonomous coinage.

The medieval coinages of the northern Balkan states are of great morphological interest. They are chiefly silver grossi, showing a mixture of Byzantine and Venetian influences. The [Bulgarians](https://www.britannica.com/place/Bulgaria) had a regular silver coinage from [Ivan Asen I](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Ivan-Asen-I) (1186–96) to Ivan Shishman (1371–93). Modern Bulgarian coinage began in 1879. The [Serbian](https://www.britannica.com/place/Serbia) coinage lasted from Stephen Vladislav I (1234–43) to the mid-15th century. There was also a coinage of the bans (local officials) of [Bosnia](https://www.britannica.com/place/Bosnia-and-Herzegovina) (late 13th to 15th century). The independent city of [Ragusa](https://www.britannica.com/place/Dubrovnik) is remarkable for the bold Roman style of its early copper (13th century) and for its rich and varied later issues.

In [Romania](https://www.britannica.com/place/Romania) a princely coinage from 1866 became a royal one, of orthodox pattern, from 1881; the 20th-century types, until the fall of the monarchy in 1947, were remarkably varied. That of [Greece](https://www.britannica.com/place/Greece) began with the republican government of 1828: the basis was the silver phoenix of 100 lepta. This was followed, under the monarchy from 1833, by the [drachma](https://www.britannica.com/money/drachma) of similar value. The 20th century emphasized the types of ancient Greece, though modern issues have broken from this tradition.

### The later Byzantine empires

From the time of [Basil II](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Basil-II) (976–1025) the fabric of the gold nomismata (successor of the solidus) and also of the silver began to change, from using a narrower, thicker blank (flan) to one wider and thinner, which was also given a curious cup shape, hence the name *nummi scyphati* (cup money); gold scyphati declined in purity until, under [Nicephorus III](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Nicephorus-III-Botaneiates) (1078–81), they were very base. Silver remained generally scarce; the issue of bronze became uneven. New conventions in legends and types were introduced: [Constantine IX](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Constantine-IX-Monomachus) (1042–55) showed on his silver an invocation to the Virgin in iambic trimeter; and an invocation used by [Romanus IV](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Romanus-IV-Diogenes) (1068–71) took the form of a hexameter, carried over from obverse to reverse. Figures of the saints appeared in the 12th century. At the same time, the intrinsic quality of the coinage had sunk to a level of desperate confusion, seen most plainly under [Alexius I Comnenus](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Alexius-I-Comnenus) (1081–1118), whose “gold” was sometimes no more than billon or even bronze. The influence of Western types was seen powerfully in the bronze struck by [Andronicus II](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Andronicus-II-Palaeologus) with, reverse, a cross pattée surrounded by a circular inscription within a double border. Western influence continued in the 15th century, especially under [John VIII Palaeologus](https://www.britannica.com/biography/John-VIII-Palaeologus), whose visit to Italy in 1438 (when Pisanello made his splendid portrait medal) doubtless familiarized him with the designs of the grosso and gros, which were imitated unmistakably on John’s silver and from which derived the English groat. By this time the Byzantine idiom in coinage was virtually dead.

With the capture of Constantinople by the crusaders in 1204, the power of the [Byzantine Empire](https://www.britannica.com/place/Byzantine-Empire) was split among a number of smaller authorities, of which the “empires” of [Thessalonica](https://www.britannica.com/place/Thessaloniki) and [Nicaea](https://www.britannica.com/place/Iznik) were short-lived: in both, the coinage (where attributable) was of normal Byzantine character. The empire of [Trebizond](https://www.britannica.com/place/Trabzon-Turkey), however, continued a separate existence until 1461; its small silver pieces, called “Comnenian white money,” were prized for their purity and enjoyed a wide [currency](https://www.britannica.com/money/currency). Through such means the influence of Byzantine types was exerted on the contemporary coinages of Armenia and elsewhere in [Asia Minor](https://www.britannica.com/place/Anatolia).

## Coins of the British Isles, colonies, and Commonwealth

### Ancient Britain

The earliest [coinage](https://www.britannica.com/money/coinage) of Britain consisted of small, cast pieces of speculum, a brittle [bronze](https://www.britannica.com/technology/bronze-alloy) [alloy](https://www.britannica.com/technology/alloy) with 20 percent tin. These coins copied the bronze of Massilia (Marseille) of the 2nd century bce and circulated, mainly in southeastern Britain, early in the 1st century bce their relationship with contemporary iron [currency](https://www.britannica.com/money/currency) bars is uncertain. At the same time, uninscribed [gold](https://www.britannica.com/science/gold-chemical-element) coins of the Gaulish [Bellovaci](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Bellovaci), a tribe located near Beauvais, imitated from the famous gold stater of [Philip II](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Philip-II-king-of-Macedonia) of Macedon, were being introduced, probably by trade. The first Belgic invasion, about 75 bce, brought variants of these, from which arose a complex family of uninscribed imitations. The study of distribution in Britain has ascribed them to fairly well-defined tribal areas in the south and east; some are crude, but the best illustrate the peak of Celtic art in Britain. The gold was of variable purity. After the second Belgic invasion (following [Caesar](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Julius-Caesar-Roman-ruler) ’s raid in 55 bce) the coinage entered a historical phase through the addition (in Latin, and with Roman titles, etc.) of the names of kings. Roman influence under Augustus prompted the introduction of [silver](https://www.britannica.com/science/silver) and [copper](https://www.britannica.com/science/copper) to reinforce the gold and the Romanization of previously “Celtic” types. [Claudius’](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Claudius-Roman-emperor) conquest in 43 ce ended native coinage except for crudely cast billion pieces long continued in the [Hampshire](https://www.britannica.com/place/Hampshire-county-England) and [Dorset](https://www.britannica.com/place/Dorset-county-England) area; the gold of the tribe of the Brigantes in what is now [Yorkshire](https://www.britannica.com/place/Yorkshire-former-county-England) was the last to disappear.

### Roman Britain

Unofficial copies of Claudian bronze were produced in Britain to alleviate the shortage of official Roman coinage after the conquest. Thereafter, no coinage was produced until the reign of the usurper [Carausius](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Marcus-Aurelius-Mausaeus-Carausius) (286–293 ce), who coined profusely in orthodox Roman fashion at Londinium (London) and elsewhere in gold, silver, and copper; the same was done briefly by [Allectus](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Allectus), his murderer (293–296 ce). [Diocletian](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Diocletian) ’s London [mint](https://www.britannica.com/money/mint-metallurgy) was continued under [Constantine](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Constantine-I-Roman-emperor) until 324 ce; thereafter, except under [Magnus Maximus](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Magnus-Maximus) (383–388 ce), whose usurpation was legitimized by the Eastern emperor [Theodosius I](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Theodosius-I), Britain lacked an official mint, being supplied with coinage mainly from Gaul. Imitative bronze pieces, however, appeared in the 3rd century and continued to be made in the 4th.

### Early Anglo-Saxon coins

Infiltration of [Merovingian](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Merovingian-dynasty) gold from France in the 6th century prompted the issue of [Anglo-Saxon](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Anglo-Saxon) gold “thirds” in the 7th; solidi were only very rarely struck, because of their high [intrinsic value](https://www.britannica.com/money/intrinsic-value). Output, never great, was confined chiefly to the [London](https://www.britannica.com/place/London) – [Kent](https://www.britannica.com/place/Kent-historical-kingdom-England) area. The London mint, almost certainly episcopal, signed its coins with the name *LONDVNIV;* Kentish coinage was mainly regal. In addition, there were a perhaps small Mercian series and another from York. A further series, copied from late 4th-century Roman prototypes, was struck about 650, when the gold content was fast diminishing. Gold coinage soon gave way to that of small thick silver sceats (meaning “a portion”; about 1.29 grams, or 20 grains) of essentially different style. Some had Runic legends, including the name [Peada](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Peada), supposedly a reference to the king (flourished 656) of [Mercia](https://www.britannica.com/place/Mercia); most, however, were nonregal, and their legends are Latinized. Types were varied, and some almost certainly originated in [Frisia](https://www.britannica.com/place/Frisia), where sceats are found in large quantities, denoting the trading connection that called for their use; these show animal and floral design. In the south the sceats lasted until about 800. Small silver sceats were developed in the mid-8th century in [Northumbria](https://www.britannica.com/place/Northumbria), where they quickly gave way to copper, which lasted until about 850.

### Anglo-Saxon penny coinages

English coinage proper began with the silver penny of [Offa](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Offa-Anglo-Saxon-king), king of Mercia (757–796). It was first struck at around the weight of the sceat, from about 790, and its weight increased to about 22 1 / 2 grains (equal to 240 to the Tower pound; the standard pound used by the Royal Mint until its replacement in 1526 by the troy pound, whose name derives from the French city of Troyes, site of a major medieval fair). The new pennies showed Carolingian influence in their broad, flat forms. Their designs, however, insofar as they were not influenced by late Roman coin portraiture, displayed a brilliant originality (both in Anglo-Saxon portraiture and also in pattern design and decorative lettering), which had no equal for some centuries. [Offa](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Offa-Anglo-Saxon-king) ’s coinage, though minted expressly for him as *Rex Merciorum,* was mainly current in the southeast and was probably struck at [Canterbury](https://www.britannica.com/place/Canterbury-England). Evidence for this lies in the fact that the moneyers of Offa were also those of the kings of [Kent](https://www.britannica.com/place/Kent-county-England), and the coins of archbishops of Canterbury, including Jaenbeorht (died 792), bore the names of Offa and his successor Cenwulf: under [Ceolwulf](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Ceolwulf) (821–823) the mint name of Canterbury appeared on the coins. Offa struck pennies with the portrait and name of his wife, Cynethryth, as *Regina M* (*erciorum*) and also issued gold pieces copying a 774 [dinar](https://www.britannica.com/money/dinar-currency) of the caliph al-Manṣūr but with the addition of *OFFA REX.* Ceremonial gold coins, like Offa’s, all now represented by unique examples, were minted, perhaps partly to pay the Romescot (an annual tax to the papal see), by Archbishop Wigmund of York (837–854?), [Edward the Elder](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Edward-Anglo-Saxon-king) (899–924), [Ethelred II](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Ethelred-the-Unready) (978–1016), and [Edward the Confessor](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Edward-king-of-England-1002-1066) (1042–66).

Offa’s coinage influenced design under the kings of Kent and [East Anglia](https://www.britannica.com/place/East-Anglia), as can be seen in the coinage of the [Wessex](https://www.britannica.com/place/Wessex-historical-kingdom) kingdom, which was produced first at Winchester, then, after the Battle of Ellendun in 825, at Canterbury, still the only permanent mint south of the [Humber](https://www.britannica.com/place/River-Humber). Under [Aethelwulf](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Aethelwulf) (839–858) a uniform type of coinage was achieved for all of southern England except East Anglia. The [Viking](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Viking-people) invaders, from about 870, left an important [mark](https://www.britannica.com/money/mark-German-currency) on English coinage, with new designs of northern European derivation. [York](https://www.britannica.com/place/York-England) and [Lincoln](https://www.britannica.com/place/Lincoln-district-England) were their principal mints, from which numerous memorial coins of Saints [Peter](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Saint-Peter-the-Apostle) and [Martin](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Saint-Martin-I) were issued. Meanwhile, [Alfred](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Alfred-king-of-Wessex) (871–899) greatly extended the Wessex kingdom, as shown by his operation of mints: Canterbury (still much the largest), [Gloucester](https://www.britannica.com/place/Gloucester-England), [Exeter](https://www.britannica.com/place/Exeter-England), [Winchester](https://www.britannica.com/place/Winchester-England), London, and possibly [Oxford](https://www.britannica.com/place/Oxford-England). His coins were of careful workmanship and showed Viking influence. In the 10th century the power of [English](https://www.britannica.com/place/England) kings spread quickly northward. Under [Athelstan](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Athelstan) (924–939) there were nearly 30 mints at work, mainly southern and central but reaching to [Chester](https://www.britannica.com/place/Chester-England); under [Edgar](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Edgar-king-of-England) (959–975) there was much more uniformity of type. The Council of Grateley under Athelstan had enacted that each permitted mint was to have but one moneyer, with specified exceptions; London, for example, had eight. By the time of [Ethelred II](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Ethelred-the-Unready) more than 70 mints were at work; London, Winchester, Lincoln, and York were the largest and most profuse. From about this time the types were generally standardized: obverse, king’s portrait, and, reverse, some cruciform design.

### Post-Conquest coinage

The [Norman Conquest](https://www.britannica.com/event/Norman-Conquest) of 1066 made little change in the mint system or in the coinage (though the facing portrait acquired great popularity); the pre-Conquest moneyers stayed in office and struck coins for [William I](https://www.britannica.com/biography/William-I-king-of-England). After his reign the number of mints tended to decline. The pennies of [William II](https://www.britannica.com/biography/William-II-king-of-England) have nothing in their legend to distinguish them from his father’s issues, but it is possible to allot eight types to William I and five to his son. Forgery gave [Henry I](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Henry-I-king-of-England) much trouble, and one step he took to prevent it was to issue his later coins with a snick in the edge to show that the silver was good. He also coined round halfpence; previously, silver pennies had to be halved or quartered to produce a smaller denomination. The civil wars of [Stephen](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Stephen-king-of-England) ’s reign produced many interesting coins, such as those struck in the claimant [Matilda](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Matilda-daughter-of-Henry-I) ’s name as *Imperatrix* and the pennies of Eustace Fitzjohn and other barons, very much on the pattern of feudal issues in France.

[Henry II](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Henry-II-king-of-England) ceased the regular change of types customary since William I’s reign and struck one type until 1180. As a result the work of the English mints reached its lowest level. His short-cross penny, so called from its reverse design, first issued in 1180, remained unchanged—including the name *Henricus* —not only by Henry II but also by [Richard](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Richard-I-duke-of-Normandy) and [John](https://www.britannica.com/biography/John-I-king-of-France) and [Henry III](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Henry-III-king-of-England-1207-1272) until 1247, when Henry III coined the long-cross penny with the arms of the cross extended to the edge of the coin to discourage clipping. He also reduced considerably the number of mints. [Edward I](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Edward-I-king-of-England) subordinated all mints to the authority of the master worker in London, William de Turnemire. In 1279 he introduced a new type of penny, with, obverse, bust of the king and, reverse, long cross with three pellets in each angle, a type that was much imitated abroad and persisted on silver until [Henry VII](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Henry-VII-king-of-England). The moneyers’ names disappeared from the reverse legends, and their place was taken by the name of the mint (e.g., *CIVITAS LONDON*). Edward I also struck halfpennies and farthings to replace the cut pennies that had hitherto done duty for small change. He also introduced a groat, or fourpenny piece, but this larger coin did not establish itself until Edward III’s reign. The coins of Edward I, II, and III can be distinguished only by a minute study of detail. Privileged ecclesiastical mints still continued active.

### Gold coinage

Henry III had attempted in 1257 to issue a gold [coinage](https://www.britannica.com/money/coinage) by striking the gold penny (45 grains) of the value of 20 pence [silver](https://www.britannica.com/science/silver), later raised to 24; but the difficulty of relating gold to silver proved insuperable, and the coinage was withdrawn. In 1344 [Edward III](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Edward-III-king-of-England) issued his fine gold series—florin, leopard, and helm (1 / 2 and 1 / 4 florin)—but his attempt to introduce a gold [currency](https://www.britannica.com/money/currency) failed. A gold coinage was finally established in currency in 1351 with a noble of 120 grains of gold and its subdivisions, the half- and quarter-noble. In the same year, the silver penny was reduced to 18 grains and the groat issued (on Flemish models). The noble was valued at six shillings and eightpence (1 / 2 mark). Its obverse, the king in a ship, is supposed to allude to the naval victory off the Flemish city of Sluis in June 1340. The reverse type is a floreate cross with considerable ornamentation. The weight of the noble was reduced by [Henry IV](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Henry-IV-king-of-England) in face of foreign competition. [Edward IV](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Edward-IV-king-of-England) distinguished his noble by a rose on the ship (rose noble, or ryal) and raised its value to 10 shillings, while a new gold coin, the angel, was introduced to replace the old value of the noble; the penny was reduced to 12 grains. The angel is so called from its type of St. Michael and Lucifer. The reverse is a ship with a cross in front of the mast. (In the 16th century the angel became the piece given to those touched for [king’s evil](https://www.britannica.com/science/kings-evil), or scrofula, in the belief that the king’s touch could cure. It was struck for this purpose down to the reign of [Charles I](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Charles-I-king-of-Great-Britain-and-Ireland), and small versions were struck by the later [Stuarts](https://www.britannica.com/topic/House-of-Stuart) and pretenders, but it was not again issued as legal tender.)

The next important change in the coinage was the introduction in 1489 of the sovereign, a splendid gold coin of 240 grains, current for 20 shillings, with, obverse, [Henry VII](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Henry-VII-king-of-England) seated on an elaborate throne and, reverse, a [Tudor](https://www.britannica.com/topic/House-of-Tudor) rose with central [shield of arms](https://www.britannica.com/topic/coat-of-arms). Henry also issued the first English [shilling](https://www.britannica.com/money/shilling), a handsome, though scarce, coin with a fine portrait, probably by John Sharp, formally appointed engraver in 1510. [Henry VII](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Henry-VII-king-of-England) altered the types of the smaller silver coins by replacing the three-centuries-old cross and pellets by a long cross and shield, while the inscription *POSVI DEVM ADIVTOREM MEVM* (“I have made God my helper”) took the place of the [mint](https://www.britannica.com/money/mint-metallurgy) legend; the stereotyped bust was replaced on the groat by an excellent profile portrait and on the penny by the king seated. [Henry VIII](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Henry-VIII-king-of-England) debased the gold coinage and reduced the weight of the sovereign, the reverse type of which was now the royal arms supported by a lion and dragon. He introduced the gold crown of five shillings, with its half, raised the angel to seven shillings and sixpence, and introduced the George noble—so called from its type of [St. George](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Saint-George) and the Dragon—to take the angel’s old value. In 1544 he issued the base shilling, or teston, of 12 pence and debased the silver coinage. When [Edward VI](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Edward-VI) again restored a coinage of fine silver, he introduced the silver [crown](https://www.britannica.com/money/crown-monetary-unit) of five shillings (the first English coin dated in Arabic numerals), which took the name of the gold piece of the same value introduced a few years earlier. The reign of [Mary](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Mary-I) is notable for the appearance of the portrait of her husband, [Philip II](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Philip-II-king-of-Spain-and-Portugal) of Spain, on the shilling.

[Elizabeth I](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Elizabeth-I) continued her father’s denominations and restored the purity of the silver coinage. She soon discontinued the groat, Edward VI having introduced the silver sixpence and threepence, although she continued its half, the twopence. Her “portcullis,” or trade coinage for use by the newly incorporated [East India Company](https://www.britannica.com/topic/East-India-Company), appeared in 1600–01. She also experimented with machinery for coinage, although the insistence of the moneyers on their immemorial right to use manual methods delayed its establishment until after the [Restoration](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Restoration-English-history-1660). [James I](https://www.britannica.com/biography/James-I-king-of-England-and-Scotland) introduced a number of new gold coins, the most important being the “unite,” or sovereign (20 shillings), so called from its legend (*Faciam eos in gentem unam* \[“I will make them into one race”\]) alluding to the union of the crowns of Scotland and England. [Charles I](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Charles-I-king-of-Great-Britain-and-Ireland) made no changes in the coinage until the [Civil War](https://www.britannica.com/event/English-Civil-Wars) (when [Parliament](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Parliament) coined in London and the king’s mint traveled with him); the king’s financial difficulties added many new coins to the English series. These included 20-shilling and 10-shilling pieces in silver, the large gold £3 pieces of [Oxford](https://www.britannica.com/place/Oxford-England), and the fine Oxford silver crown, with a view of Oxford below the usual type of the king on horseback, made by the engraver Thomas Rawlins, employed at the Oxford Mint (1642–46) under its master, Thomas Bushell; the siege pieces rudely struck on silver plate at various Royalist strongholds show to what straits the king’s party was reduced. Under James I and Charles I are found the first English [copper](https://www.britannica.com/science/copper) coins, the “Harrington” farthings, which were struck under contract. From 1649, copper tokens, mainly of farthing value, were produced in large numbers by many municipalities and private traders. The coinage of the Commonwealth (1649–60) is remarkable for the simplicity of its types, and this is the only period of English coinage when the legends have been in English. Coins struck with the lord protector [Cromwell](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Oliver-Cromwell) ’s bust and superscription, although not uncommon, apart from the 1656 half crowns, seem never to have circulated.

### Modern coinage

The modern coinage dates from the reign of [Charles II](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Charles-II-king-of-Great-Britain-and-Ireland). After issuing the old denomination of hammered [money](https://www.britannica.com/money/money) in the first two years of his reign, he replaced the unite, or broad, in 1662 by the guinea, so called from the provenance of its gold. This was a 20-shilling piece. It was not until 1717, after various oscillations, that its value was fixed at 21 shillings. His silver coins were the crown, half-crown, shilling, and so on, all regularly and beautifully struck on the new mill that was then established at London’s Tower Mint. In 1672 he introduced the copper half-penny and farthing with the Britannia type. The finest coin of his reign is not a regular issue. It was the “Petition” crown made by Thomas Simon, engraver at the mint under the Commonwealth, and bears on the edge a petition to the king that he might be given the same office under the restored monarchy. For the great recoinage under [William III](https://www.britannica.com/biography/William-III-king-of-England-Scotland-and-Ireland), provincial mints were briefly opened at Bristol, Exeter, Chester, Norwich, and York. Of 18th-century coinage mention may be made of the practice of recording the provenance of the metal of particular issues, as in the *VIGO* issues of Anne struck from captured Spanish bullion in 1702, the *S* (*outh*) *S* (*ea*) *C* (*ompany*) silver of George I, and the *LIMA* coinage of George II made of bullion brought by Admiral Anson from his voyage around the world. Toward the end of the century the scarcity of government silver was largely made good by Spanish dollars, and by tokens issued by the [Bank of England](https://www.britannica.com/money/Bank-of-England). The deficiency in copper, briefly remedied by large “cartwheel” issues, was made up by private issues of vast numbers of tokens. In 1816 a great recoinage took place with the introduction of the sovereign and silver coins, each with Benedetto Pistrucci’s design, St. George and the Dragon. Britain was on the [gold standard](https://www.britannica.com/money/gold-standard) from 1821. In 1849, the two-shilling piece (florin) was issued, and the “gothic” florin of 1852 proved a most popular coin. The double florin, which was first issued in 1887, did not take the public fancy; the practical disappearance of the crown piece from circulation also reflects the public dislike of large coins, though commemorative crowns have remained popular.

The gold sovereign disappeared from internal currency in 1914 after a career of 300 years, but it has continued to be struck in irregular quantities for export abroad. Silver was alloyed up to 50 percent in 1920 and in 1947 gave way to cupronickel: the silver threepence was replaced by an angular coin of nickel-brass.

On February 15, 1971, the U.K. currency was decimalized. With 100 “new pence” to the pound, the decimal coinage was based on denominations of these new pence (1 / 2 \[since demonetized\], one, two, five, 10, 50); the sixpence coin continued briefly as a 2 1 / 2 -pence coin before being phased out, as were the old penny and threepence coins. On April 21, 1983, a £1 coin was introduced bearing the head of [Elizabeth II](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Elizabeth-II), obverse, and the royal coat of arms, reverse. In subsequent years versions were introduced bearing Elizabeth II, obverse, and a variety of emblematic reverse designs representing the United Kingdom and its constituent parts, including a thistle (Scotland, 1984), a leek (Wales, 1985), a flax plant (Northern Ireland, 1986), and an oak tree (England,1987). Royal maundy money (since the 18th century) is maintained with the issue of silver pieces of onepenny, twopence, threepence, and fourpence: the silver penny and groat thus survive.

[Wales](https://www.britannica.com/place/Wales) has had no coinage, except perhaps for the penny of the chieftain Howel Dda (909–950).

### Scotland

Coinage began by following English usage in regard to types and weights: the earliest [silver](https://www.britannica.com/science/silver) pennies were those of [David I](https://www.britannica.com/biography/David-I) (1124–53) and copied Stephen’s, though the use of profile portraits in the 13th and 14th centuries showed an interesting divergence. Gold nobles and silver groats were issued by [David II](https://www.britannica.com/biography/David-II) in 1356–57 on the standard of Edward III. From [Robert III](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Robert-III) onward the French or Flemish standard for [gold](https://www.britannica.com/science/gold-chemical-element) was preferred, and during the 16th century, especially under [James V](https://www.britannica.com/biography/James-V) and Mary, a strong continental influence on design was apparent in a series of gold coins of originality and frequent beauty. Silver coins had begun to show debasement of metal, and as early as [James III](https://www.britannica.com/biography/James-III-king-of-Scotland) [copper](https://www.britannica.com/science/copper) small change—“black” farthings—had been introduced. The Scottish [coinage](https://www.britannica.com/money/coinage) of James VI ([James I](https://www.britannica.com/biography/James-I-king-of-England-and-Scotland) of England) marked a peak in range and variety: after the union of the crowns in 1603, Scots coinage decreased in quantity and ceased in 1707 after the [union of the Scottish and English parliaments](https://www.britannica.com/event/Act-of-Union-Great-Britain-1707). Hitherto the value of Scottish coinage in relation to English had been 12:1. Under [George VI](https://www.britannica.com/biography/George-VI) a [shilling](https://www.britannica.com/money/shilling) with a Scottish reverse was first coined as part of the general British series.

### Ireland

Irish [currency](https://www.britannica.com/money/currency) from the 8th to the 10th century consisted mainly of Anglo-Saxon, French, Viking, and Arabic silver; in the later 10th and 11th centuries silver pennies of the Norse kings of Dublin imitated Anglo-Saxon and Scandinavian models. There were also thin silver bracteates copying Norman types. Anglo-Irish coinage proper began with silver pennies and halfpence of John (the only coins to bear his name, which did not appear on English coins). [Dublin](https://www.britannica.com/place/Dublin), [Waterford](https://www.britannica.com/place/Waterford-county-Ireland), [Cork](https://www.britannica.com/place/Cork-county-Ireland), [Limerick](https://www.britannica.com/place/Limerick-county-Ireland), and [Trim](https://www.britannica.com/place/Trim-Ireland) were striking silver (increasingly base) from groat to farthing from the 13th to the 15th century. The “three crowns” coinage with the saltire cross (the Fitzgerald arms) beside the shield came in with [Edward IV](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Edward-IV-king-of-England) and was continued by [Richard III](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Richard-III-king-of-England) and Henry VII. “Harp” groats were struck at Dublin under Henry VIII, followed by his much baser issues. Gold was never coined, but copper was introduced quite early. In Ireland as in England, the [English Civil Wars](https://www.britannica.com/event/English-Civil-Wars) produced a number of siege pieces, notably the [money](https://www.britannica.com/money/money) of the Irish peers Inchiquin and Ormonde. For his Irish campaign James II issued his “gun-money” series of [brass](https://www.britannica.com/technology/brass-alloy) (made partly from melted-down old cannon), to be redeemed in silver when he should regain the throne.

In 1723 there was uproar in Ireland over the monopoly granted to the English entrepreneur [William Wood](https://www.britannica.com/biography/William-Wood-English-ironmaster-circa-1723) to [mint](https://www.britannica.com/money/mint-metallurgy) a debased Irish coinage, derisorily termed “Wood’s halfpence.” Under pressure from, among others, [Jonathan Swift](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Jonathan-Swift), the satirist, whose “Drapier’s Letters” furiously attacked him, Wood revoked his patent in 1725 (*see below* [Coins of the United States](https://www.britannica.com/money/coin/Coins-of-the-United-States#ref16050)). Irish coinage was discontinued in 1822; from then on, Irish needs were served by British coinage. In 1928 the coinage of the Irish Free State (later the republic of Ireland) was introduced, with, obverse, harp on all denominations, and reverses bearing a range of animal, bird, and fish designs. In February 1971 the coinage of the republic was decimalized.

### Isle of Man and Channel Islands

The Isle of Man first had its own coinage, in bronze, from 1709 to 1733 under the earls of Derby; this was continued, in 1758 only, for the earls of Athol. Regal coinage in bronze appeared intermittently from 1786 to 1839. The characteristic badge was the “three-legs,” or triskelis, forming the spokes of a wheel. Since 1840, English issues have been current.

[Jersey](https://www.britannica.com/place/Jersey-island-Channel-Islands-English-Channel) and [Guernsey](https://www.britannica.com/place/Guernsey-island-and-bailiwick-Channel-Islands-English-Channel) have had their own bronze coinage for well over a century, showing the shield of three leopards proper to the Duchy of Normandy. Variation of types has occurred since [World War II](https://www.britannica.com/event/World-War-II), the end of which prompted also the special issue of the Jersey “liberation penny” to [mark](https://www.britannica.com/money/mark-German-currency) the end of the German occupation. The coinage was decimalized in February 1971.

### Colonies and Commonwealth

British colonial issues, begun under [Elizabeth I](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Elizabeth-I) with silver for the [East India Company](https://www.britannica.com/topic/East-India-Company), were extended in the 17th century. [New England](https://www.britannica.com/place/New-England) colonists struck the silver “pine tree” and “oak tree” money from 1652; [Charles II](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Charles-II-king-of-Great-Britain-and-Ireland) had silver rupees coined at Bombay for the East India Company with the company’s arms; silver and copper “hog money” (obverse, boar; reverse, ship) was issued for [Bermuda](https://www.britannica.com/place/Bermuda); and James II struck tin coins for American plantations.

There were few official attempts to provide colonial coinages in the 18th century; thus, currency in the British [West Indies](https://www.britannica.com/place/West-Indies-island-group-Atlantic-Ocean) was based on Spanish, Portuguese, and Brazilian gold and especially on Spanish silver dollars, normally cut and counterstamped. Spanish dollars were similarly used in the early 19th century at [Sierra Leone](https://www.britannica.com/place/Sierra-Leone). In the 19th century, however, colonial issues proper multiplied. That of the [Ionian Islands](https://www.britannica.com/place/Ionian-Islands), from 1819, was among the earliest. In [Malta](https://www.britannica.com/place/Malta) one-third farthings were issued by [William IV](https://www.britannica.com/biography/William-IV-king-of-Great-Britain) and [Victoria](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Victoria-queen-of-United-Kingdom). [Gibraltar](https://www.britannica.com/place/Gibraltar) had copper from 1842. Farther afield, token bronze had been coined for [Nova Scotia](https://www.britannica.com/place/Nova-Scotia) and [New Brunswick](https://www.britannica.com/place/New-Brunswick-province) from 1823; a general coinage for [Canada](https://www.britannica.com/place/Canada) appeared in 1858. [Ceylon](https://www.britannica.com/place/Sri-Lanka) ’s coinage began with bronze half- and quarter-farthings and silver three-halfpence from 1838. The private *raj* of Sarawak had coinage from 1841. [Australian](https://www.britannica.com/place/Australia) coinage of sovereigns started as early as 1855; its unit was changed to that of the [dollar](https://www.britannica.com/money/dollar) on February 14, 1966. In [Cape Colony](https://www.britannica.com/place/Cape-Colony) little coinage was produced until the [Boer](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Boer-people) republic of [South Africa](https://www.britannica.com/place/South-Africa) had been incorporated in the Union. Silver and bronze for [Hong Kong](https://www.britannica.com/place/Hong-Kong) began in 1863, and in closely succeeding years colonial issues were started for [Jamaica](https://www.britannica.com/place/Jamaica), [Cyprus](https://www.britannica.com/place/Cyprus), [Mauritius](https://www.britannica.com/place/Mauritius), [Zanzibar](https://www.britannica.com/place/Zanzibar-Tanzania), [North Borneo](https://www.britannica.com/place/Sabah-state-Malaysia), [Honduras](https://www.britannica.com/place/Honduras), and elsewhere.

In the 20th century, coins of the colonies continued in general to show a crowned bust of the monarch; those of the self-governing [Commonwealth](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Commonwealth-association-of-states) powers exchanged a crowned for an uncrowned bust. [New Zealand](https://www.britannica.com/place/New-Zealand) issues, with [Maori](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Maori) designs prominent, began only in 1933. [Indian](https://www.britannica.com/place/India) and [Pakistani](https://www.britannica.com/place/Pakistan) coinages, each bilingual with English, grew out of the imperial Indian coinage, the British sovereign’s head being replaced in [India](https://www.britannica.com/place/India) by pictorial designs and in Muslim [Pakistan](https://www.britannica.com/place/Pakistan) by calligraphic and symbolic devices.

Generally, Commonwealth and colonial coins alike have emphasized on their reverses either national symbols or national heraldic devices. Those U.K. dependencies that had not by February 1971 decimalized their currencies adopted the new decimal currency that the United Kingdom introduced at that time. The currencies of the many nations that achieved independence in the second half of the 20th century exhibited a variety of types, including portraits, traditional emblems, and renderings of indigenous flora and fauna.

## Coins of Latin America

### The colonial period

Spanish colonists carried to the New World the Castilian [currency](https://www.britannica.com/money/currency) system, which had been regulated as to standard, weight, and size of the coins within a bimetallic pattern by the ordinances of Ferdinand and Isabella issued in Medina del Campo in 1497. The double base of the system consisted of the [gold](https://www.britannica.com/science/gold-chemical-element) excelente (replaced in 1535 by the [escudo](https://www.britannica.com/topic/escudo)) and the [silver](https://www.britannica.com/science/silver) real. The coins of Spanish America were specifically: in gold, the escudo (3.38 grams), two-escudos, four-escudos, eight-escudos, or onza (the famous gold ounce), and the half-escudo, or escudito; in silver, the real (3.43 and 3.38 grams), the half-real and the quarter-real, or cuartillo, and the two-reales, four-reales, and eight-reales (this last known also as the duro, or [peso](https://www.britannica.com/money/peso) fuerte). During the 16th century, for a brief period, a coin of three reales was minted in Mexico. Gold was not minted in a uniform manner until after the second half of the 17th century; until then Hispanic-American currency had been almost exclusively silver [coinage](https://www.britannica.com/money/coinage). Copper was rarely minted in Spanish America.

The hammered coinage of Spanish America frequently presents a relatively tidy appearance, being very nearly round and containing all the lettering and required symbols; but the press or mill type coinage is frequently of very poor appearance. These coins of rude mintage are called macuquinas (cob). In the 18th century, by ordinances of Philip V, the setting up of machinery for the minting of a perfectly round coinage, with milled and corded (ropelike) edge, became mandatory.

The type of the Hispanic-American coin was very characteristic: its most constant elements were the [Pillars of Hercules](https://www.britannica.com/place/Pillars-of-Heracles) and the motto *Plus Ultra,* plus the monarchy’s [coat of arms](https://www.britannica.com/topic/coat-of-arms). In edge-milled coinage the same elements were employed in silver pieces, with the addition between the Pillars of an image of the two crowned hemispheres; this was called the moneda columnaria (“columnar coinage”) and was minted until 1772. From that date, by ordinances of Charles III, silver coinage carried on the face a bust of the reigning monarch and on the reverse the coat of arms, a system already utilized in the gold pieces.

### Hispanic-American colonial mints

At the beginning of the colonial period, stamped metal foundry pieces frequently substituted for scarce currency. In time, several mints were established, of which the Mexican (1535–1821) and the one at Potosí (1574–1825) were particularly important. Other minor ones, and their dates of operation, were those of [Santo Domingo](https://www.britannica.com/place/Santo-Domingo) (1542 to the end of the 16th century and 1818 to 1821), Lima (1568 to 1570, 1575 to 1588, 1659 to 1660, and 1684 to 1824), [Santa Fe de Bogotá](https://www.britannica.com/place/Bogota) (1626 to 1821), Guatemala (1731 to 1822), Santiago de Chile (1749 to 1817), Popayán (1732 and 1749 to 1822), and Cuzco (1698 and 1824). Coinage of any of these mints had uniform currency throughout the entire Spanish Empire, and the pieces had uniformity of type. They were distinguished by the symbol of the [mint](https://www.britannica.com/money/mint-metallurgy), carried on every coin. The following are some of the symbols used: Mexico, *M*; Potosí, *P* and, in the edge-milled coins, *PTSI* and *PTS* in monogram fashion; Lima, *P,**L,* and, in the edge-milled coins, *LIMA* and *LIMAE* in monogram fashion; Santiago de Chile, *S*; Guatemala, *G* and *NG* (for Nueva Guatemala); Santa Fe de Bogotá, *NR* (for Nuevo Reino); Popayán, *P, PN,* and *P* <sup><em>N</em></sup>; Santo Domingo, *SD*; Cuzco, *C* ° and *CUZ.*

### Dissemination of Hispanic-American coinage

The larger silver and gold pieces, the eight-reales, or pesos fuertes, and the ounces, became in modern times the international currency par excellence. Their dissemination throughout the world was brought about by the uniformity of their standard and milling characteristics. In many countries they were counterstamped to adapt them to a local monetary system or to authorize their currency.

### Emergency coinages in the era of independence

During the wars of independence, between 1810 and 1826, emergency mints were established in different parts of the continent, by the royalists as well as by the patriots. The coinages were almost always crudely designed, being in some instances merely foundry coinage. On other occasions the coins had merely fiduciary value—that is, no [intrinsic value](https://www.britannica.com/money/intrinsic-value) at all—as was the case with the numerous coinages of the Mexican patriot [José María Morelos](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Jose-Maria-Morelos) (1765–1815), who produced eight-real pieces in [copper](https://www.britannica.com/science/copper). Only in Mexico were there mints of any importance, situated in 10 different localities. The coinage situation became further complicated when the authorities of the opposing forces started counterstamping each other’s coins in order to use them within their own camps.

### The independent countries

The independent states that arose in Latin America after the revolutions of 1810 proceeded to mint new coins, retaining the bimetallic system established by Spain, with units in reales and escudos, except for copper fractionary units. After 1850, within a period of about 15 years, all the states adopted the [decimal system](https://www.britannica.com/science/decimal), and the peso became the unit, though in several cases it took a special name. Within the second half of the 19th century, [bimetallism](https://www.britannica.com/money/bimetallism) was generally replaced by the [gold standard](https://www.britannica.com/money/gold-standard), which in the 20th century was replaced in turn by fiduciary currency or paper [money](https://www.britannica.com/money/money), coinages being limited to fractionary pieces or to “merchandise coins” (trade tokens with little inherent metal value).

### Brazil

Coins minted in Spanish America circulated abundantly in Brazil from the 17th to the 19th century. They were given their official value in terms of the Portuguese reis, the corresponding amount being indicated by counterstamping. Hispanic-American eight-real pieces carried an overstamp that was at first of 480 reis, increasing until in edge-milled coins it amounted to 960 reis. By the 18th century, mints were established in Rio de Janeiro, Bahia, and Pernambuco, but joint circulation of both Hispanic-American and Portuguese coinages continued. Counterstamping ceased during the first decades of the 19th century, although Hispanic-American eight-real pieces and the equivalent coins of the independent Latin-American countries continued to be reminted with the value of 960 reis for some time. The Brazilian monetary unit that eventually became the milreis later became the cruzeiro, divided into 100 cents.

## Coins of the United States

The first coins struck in the North American Colonies were [silver](https://www.britannica.com/science/silver) shillings, sixpences, and threepences, made by silversmiths John Hull and Robert Sanderson at a [mint](https://www.britannica.com/money/mint-metallurgy) in Boston from 1652 to 1682, by order of the general court of [Massachusetts Bay Colony](https://www.britannica.com/place/Massachusetts-Bay-Colony). This mint dated its coins 1652 over the entire 30-year period to conceal the continuous mintage from British authorities in London.

With very few exceptions, the coins circulating in the Colonies until the Revolution were unauthorized private issues or old worn coppers no longer acceptable in England or Ireland. Silver was rare (consisting mainly of Spanish and Mexican dollars) and [gold](https://www.britannica.com/science/gold-chemical-element) almost nonexistent. Copper was then a semiprecious metal, and in theory (though seldom in practice) 24 [copper](https://www.britannica.com/science/copper) halfpence contained a [shilling’s](https://www.britannica.com/money/shilling) worth of copper. Some of the Colonies, notably those in [New England](https://www.britannica.com/place/New-England), repeatedly experimented with paper [money](https://www.britannica.com/money/money), with disastrous results. Ostensibly to satisfy the colonists’ needs for metallic [currency](https://www.britannica.com/money/currency), but in reality for the benefit of owners of mines in Cornwall, the Royal Mint in 1688 issued tin farthings bearing the image of James II on horseback and the curious denomination of 1 / 24 of a Spanish real. The Rosa Americana pieces, struck by [William Wood](https://www.britannica.com/biography/William-Wood-English-ironmaster-circa-1723) of Wolverhampton under royal patent dated July 12, 1722, received a disappointingly small circulation in [New York](https://www.britannica.com/place/New-York-state) and New England. Another [coinage](https://www.britannica.com/money/coinage) by Wood in 1722–24, intended for Ireland but rejected there because of scandalous circumstances surrounding his purchase of the royal patent, was shipped to the North American Colonies. Later these coins were supplemented by quantities of lightweight imitation halfpence, made principally in Birmingham, Eng. Alone among the Colonies, Virginia (because of a provision of its 1606 charter) had an official copper coinage executed at the Royal Mint in 1773. [New Hampshire](https://www.britannica.com/place/New-Hampshire-state) authorized William Moulton to make coppers in 1776, but the number was extremely small. The [Continental Congress](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Continental-Congress), colonial delegates of the incipient United States, uttered [pewter](https://www.britannica.com/technology/pewter) dollars in the same year to provide moral support for its inflated paper currency. These bore a sundial, the word *Fugio* (“I flee”), the motto “Mind Your Business,” and 13 links for the united colonies.

The end of the [American Revolution](https://www.britannica.com/event/American-Revolution) in 1783 occasioned the manufacture and circulation of immense quantities of British copper tokens designed for the American trade. Between 1785 and 1789 the Republic of Vermont and the states of Connecticut, [New Jersey](https://www.britannica.com/place/New-Jersey), and Massachusetts awarded contracts to various individuals to strike copper coins, and Congress similarly licensed James Jarvis in 1787 to make cents of the same design as the 1776 dollars. All these ventures were failures, the authorized coins being driven out of circulation by British tokens, Birmingham halfpence, and the lightweight issues of “Machin’s Mill” (a clandestine mint near Newburgh, N.Y.). The copper panic of 1789–90 followed, coppers of all kinds dropping to 72 to the shilling from their former 14 or 15.

Congressional efforts to establish a national mint had resulted in the issue of the historic 1783 Nova Constellatio silver patterns of 1,000, 500, and 100 units, from dies by the Englishman Benjamin Dudley, exemplifying the extraordinary Morris Plan, drawn up by Robert Morris, superintendent of finance, which reconciled the diverse colonial moneys of account. In 1786, however, Congress adopted instead the proposals of [Thomas Jefferson](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Thomas-Jefferson) for a decimal monetary system based on the [dollar](https://www.britannica.com/money/dollar), and in 1792 the mint was finally built in Philadelphia, with [David Rittenhouse](https://www.britannica.com/biography/David-Rittenhouse) as director. Jefferson tried vainly to hire as die engraver a Swiss, Jean Pierre Droz, who nevertheless furnished dies, hubs, and presses. Before the mint was quite ready, the first official American silver coin, the half dime, was struck in October 1792 in John Harper’s cellar a short distance away, from dies by Robert Birch and [Joseph Wright](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Joseph-Wright-English-painter), who were also responsible for the regular cents and half cents of 1793. Silver followed in 1794 and gold in 1795, the engraver being Robert Scot.

Later designers of American coins included [Gilbert Stuart](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Gilbert-Stuart) (1796 silver), Titian Peale and [Thomas Sully](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Thomas-Sully-American-artist) (the 1836 dollars engraved by Christian Gobrecht), [Augustus Saint-Gaudens](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Augustus-Saint-Gaudens) (1907–33 10- and 20-dollar gold pieces, called eagles and double eagles), Bela Lyon Pratt (1908–29 half eagles and quarter eagles), Victor Brenner (the Lincoln cent), [James Earle Fraser](https://www.britannica.com/biography/James-Earle-Fraser) (the buffalo nickel), A.A.

Fraser, and Chester Beach and [Gutzon Borglum](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Gutzon-Borglum) (various commemorative coins).

Augustus Saint-Gaudens, *c.* 1910.

The discovery of gold and silver in various regions and the difficulty of transporting large quantities of bullion through country menaced by Indians and bandits prompted the founding of both private and federal local mints. The Bechtlers of Rutherfordton, N.C., coined locally mined gold long before the government built a mint in Charlotte. The California [gold rush](https://www.britannica.com/money/gold-rush) stimulated coining by many bankers and assayers. Private coinage was legal so long as the coins contained full bullion weight and purity and imitated no official issues; Bechtler and Moffat gold (the latter coined at San Francisco) circulated at about par until the Civil War, while lightweight private gold took a discount. The California private mints mostly ceased operations when the San Francisco federal branch started, but those in the less accessible regions of Colorado continued long afterward, and as late as 1901 Joseph Lesher struck octagonal silver dollars in that state.

Figure of Liberty on a U.S. $20 gold piece designed for Pres. Theodore Roosevelt by Augustus Saint-Gaudens, 1907. The relief being too high, the coin proved unsuitable for circulation. In the American Numismatic Society, New York City. Diameter 34 mm.

From 1851 to 1900 many brief experiments with odd denominations were tried, all of which proved superfluous. A law of 1873 discontinued the silver dollar until political pressure from mine owners forced through Congress an 1878 act requiring the mint to buy $2,000,000 to $4,000,000 worth of silver monthly and coin the entire amount into silver dollars. Coinage was discontinued in 1935. Millions of the silver dollars long remained stored in banks and treasury vaults, but eventually they became scarce; and in 1964 a new minting was authorized. Gold was recalled in 1934, but gold coins of numismatic interest (*see* [coin collecting](https://www.britannica.com/topic/coin-collecting)) may be retained in any quantity by “collectors of rare and unusual coin” (Presidential Order 6260). By an act of 1853 all silver coins except the dollar are [fiduciary](https://www.britannica.com/money/fiduciary). The passing of 19th-century artistic canons has been reflected in American coin designs, which since 1909 have portrayed statesmen rather than personifications of liberty. All the above influences have combined to make the 20th-century American coinage system the simplest in use in any major nation.

## Coins of Asia

### Ancient Persia

### Achaemenids

The ancient kingdoms of the Middle East—Egyptian, Sumerian, Babylonian, Assyrian, and Hittite—had no coined [money](https://www.britannica.com/money/money). The use of coins reached Persia from the Lydian kingdom of Croesus and the Persian satrapies of [Asia Minor](https://www.britannica.com/place/Anatolia). The first ruler of the [Achaemenid dynasty](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Achaemenid-dynasty) to strike coins was probably [Darius I](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Darius-I) (522–486 bc), as the Greek historian [Herodotus](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Herodotus-Greek-historian) suggests. The coins of the dynasty were the daric struck from [gold](https://www.britannica.com/science/gold-chemical-element) of very pure quality and the siglos in silver; 20 sigloi (shekels) made a daric, which weighed 8.4 grams. The types of both coins were the same: obverse, the [Persian](https://www.britannica.com/place/Iran) king in a kneeling position holding a bow in his left hand and a spear in his right; reverse, only a rough irregular incuse caused in the striking. These roughly oval pieces were uninscribed and remained in issue unaltered in type until the fall of the empire. The issue of gold was the royal prerogative, but the conquered Greek and other cities and states were allowed to issue [silver](https://www.britannica.com/science/silver) and [copper](https://www.britannica.com/science/copper), while a number of Persian satraps struck silver in their own names, producing some of the earliest and finest coin portraits. At the fall of the empire, various [satraps](https://www.britannica.com/topic/satrap) struck silver coins of their own.

### Parthians

Alexander’s [coinage](https://www.britannica.com/money/coinage) and that of the Seleucids were purely Greek in character. In the mid-3rd century bc the Parthians became a [great power](https://www.britannica.com/topic/great-power) in Persia. They had an extensive but monotonous coinage in silver (tetradrachms and drachmas) and copper. The coins do not bear the name of the issuer but that of Arsaces, which was used as a dynastic title. Some of the coins are dated in the Seleucid era; on the later coins the Greek becomes corrupt and is often joined by an inscription in Persian. Some local dynasties (e.g., of Persis and Characene), vassals of the Parthian kings, also struck coins.

### Sāsānians

The Sāsānian coinage was very extensive in silver, and the early emperors also coined gold and copper, although rarely. The coin types throughout the dynasty are the same: on the obverse is a bust of the king with his name and titles, and on the reverse a fire altar, usually with two attendant priests. From about the 4th century ad, with a few earlier examples, the reverse legend gives the [mint](https://www.britannica.com/money/mint-metallurgy) and the regnal year of issue. The standard of the gold coins is derived from that of the Roman solidi; the silver coins are drachmas following the Parthian standard and are remarkable for their broad, thin form, which was copied by the Arabs for their silver coins.

### Islamic coins of the West and of western Asia and Central Asia

The conquering Muslims at first mimicked the coinage of their predecessors. In the western provinces they issued gold and copper pieces imitated from contemporary Byzantine coins, modifying the cross on the reverse of the latter somewhat to suit Muslim sensibilities. In the eastern provinces the Arab governors issued silver dirhams that were copies of late Sāsānian coins (mostly of those of Khosrow II; with the addition of short Arabic inscriptions on the margin and often the name of the Arab governor in Pahlavi; even the crude representation of the fire altar was retained. Toward the end of the 7th century, the fifth Umayyad caliph, [ʿAbd al-Malik](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Abd-al-Malik-Umayyad-caliph), instituted a coinage more in keeping with the principles of Islam. This “reformed coinage” was of gold (first issued in ad 698–699), silver (first issued in 696–697), and copper. The old coin, called [dinar](https://www.britannica.com/money/dinar-currency) (from the Aramaic derivation of the Roman denarius aureus), derived its standard (4.25 grams) from the Byzantine solidus; the standard of the silver coin ([dirham](https://www.britannica.com/topic/dirham), from the name of the Sāsānian coin, which in its turn was derived from Greek drachma) was reduced to 2.92 grams, but it retained in its thin material and style some features of its Sāsānian predecessor; the name of the copper change, *fals,* comes from the Latin word *follis* (“money bag,” by derivation a copper coin of low value). The reformed gold and silver coinage has no pictorial type, only skillfully arranged inscriptions, which are nonetheless of high historical value.

Khosrow II, coin, ad 590–628; in the collection of the American Numismatic Society.

The reformed dinar and dirham bear on the obverse the Muslim profession of faith—“There is no god but God: he has no associate”—and around it the marginal legend “In the name of God; this dinar (or dirham) was struck at... in the year....” The reverse area has a quotation from Qurʾān CXII, “Say: He is Allah, the One! / Allah, the eternally Besought of all! / He begetteth not nor was begotten. / and there is none comparable unto Him.” Around is Qurʾān IX, 33: “He it is who hath sent His messenger with the guidance and the Religion of Truth, that He may cause it to prevail over all religion, however much the idolators may be averse.”

In the mid-8th century the ʿAbbāsids overthrew the Umayyad caliphate but at first made little change in the coinage. In time the caliph’s name was added and, at the provincial mints, that of the local governor, and in the 9th century a second marginal inscription was added: “Allah’s is the command in the former case and in the latter—and in that day believers will rejoice / In Allah’s help to victory.” (Qurʾān XXX, 4–5).

The [ʿAbbāsid](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Abbasid-caliphate) caliphate broke up in the 9th and 10th centuries, and the succeeding independent rulers regularly put their own names on the coins, although they retained that of the caliph of Baghdad, whose nominal authority was still recognized. Thus, in northern Africa and Egypt the Idrīsids, Aghlabids, Ṭūlūnids, and Ikhshīdids had their own coinage. From the eastern provinces there are the coins of the Ṭāhirids, Ṣaffārids (both in the 9th century), and the Būyids (10th–11th century). In [Central Asia](https://www.britannica.com/place/Central-Asia) there was the extensive coinage of the Ṣāmānids, mainly in silver. In northern Africa and Egypt the extensive Fāṭimid [currency](https://www.britannica.com/money/currency) in gold introduced a new type of dinar with legends arranged in three concentric circles. In the west the Umayyads of Spain issued a copious coinage from the mid-8th to the beginning of the 11th century, first in silver and later also in gold; their tradition was continued during the 11th century by the small local rulers of Spain who succeeded them and by the Almoravids, who united Morocco and Spain in one empire.

Islamic gold coinage became one of the great currencies of the medieval world, and the dinar enjoyed great popularity on the western shores of the Mediterranean. It was referred to in Europe in earlier times under the name of *mancusus,* while the Almoravid dinar was known as *morabiti* (whence Spanish *maravedi*). The quarter dinars (known as taris) of the [Fāṭimids](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Fatimid-dynasty), who ruled also in Sicily, were imitated in southern Italy and Sicily and by their Norman successors. Huge quantities of silver dirhams also reached eastern and northern Europe and especially (as a result of the fur trade) Scandinavia.

The [Almohads](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Almohads), who succeeded the Almoravids in the 12th century, introduced a coinage that was new in both standard and form. Their fine gold dinars (2.3 grams) are among the most beautiful coins of the Muslim world; the dirham (1.5 grams) is square. The coinage of the Almohads survived also among their successors, well into the late Middle Ages, and was also widely current, and imitated, on the European shores of the Mediterranean.

In the east the successors of the [Seljuqs](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Seljuq) (Artukids, Zangids, etc.), who, because of the scarcity of silver, issued large copper coins, introduced a striking innovation: they adopted types borrowed from ancient Greek and Roman, Sāsānian, and Byzantine sources. The Seljuqs of Asia Minor (12th–13th century) had silver coins showing a horseman with a mace over his shoulders, or a lion and sun. Farther east the [Ghaznavids](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Ghaznavid-dynasty) (10th–12th century), on their conquest of India, struck coins with Sanskrit inscriptions.

In the 13th [century](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Yuan-dynasty) the Mongols swept through all Asia except India. The khans of the [Golden Horde](https://www.britannica.com/place/Golden-Horde) issued an extensive series of small silver coins (which influenced early Russian coinage). The Il-Khans of Persia struck large and handsome coins in all three metals. In the 14th century, [Timur](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Timur) (Tamerlane) revived the power of the Mongols and struck silver and copper coins. His son Shahrukh introduced a new type of dirham, with, obverse, profession of the faith with the name of the first four caliphs on the margin and, on the reverse, his title.

Meanwhile, the new gold Venetian [ducat](https://www.britannica.com/topic/ducat) spread in the East. It was used until the 18th century, and its standard (3.56 grams) was adopted for Islamic coins.

### Ottoman Empire

The original [coinage](https://www.britannica.com/money/coinage) of the Ottomans consisted of small [silver](https://www.britannica.com/science/silver) coins (*akche,* called asper by Europeans). Gold coins were not struck before the end of the 15th century; before and after that century, foreign [gold](https://www.britannica.com/science/gold-chemical-element), mainly the Venetian ducat, was used. A notable Ottoman innovation was the *tughra,* an elaborate monogram formed of the sultan’s name and titles, which occupies one side of the coin. Various European silver dollars also circulated extensively.

### Later Persia, Afghanistan, and Turkistan

The earlier coins of the shahs of Persia were large, thin silver pieces of Central Asian style, but in the 18th century the coins became smaller and thicker, as in India. Legends were usually in rhyming couplets; gold was scarce until the 18th century. Cities issued [copper](https://www.britannica.com/science/copper) with local emblems.

The emirs of Afghanistan, who became independent of Persia in the 18th century, struck gold and silver on the standard of the Mughal emperors, whose poetic inscriptions they also copied. Of the various smaller modern dynasties that ruled [Central Asia](https://www.britannica.com/place/Central-Asia) until the Russian conquest, the emirs of Bukhara and of Khokand were notable for their extensive issues in gold. From the 19th century gradual westernization resulted in the adoption of European types.

### India

Ancient and early medieval. India derived the idea of coinage from the Greek world via Iran. The earliest coins were weighed from pieces of stamped silver and were decorated with stylized depictions of animals and plants. These coins were soon augmented by copper ones, some made in the same way, others by casting. These pieces circulated over most of northern India during the 4th to 1st centuries bc. From the 1st century bc onward there were also copper coinages of numerous small states, tribes, and dynasties, which show increasing Greek influence. Their few silver coins were directly influenced by the hemidrachms of the Greek rulers of northwestern India of the 1st century bc.

Early in the 2nd century bc the Greeks of [Bactria](https://www.britannica.com/place/Bactria) began to invade India, and their coinage is remarkable for its fine series of portraits and for the number of names it records of rulers otherwise unknown. Prākrit legends began to appear alongside Greek and, as the Greek rulers were replaced by Central Asian invaders who copied their types, the Greek deities gradually gave place to local ones on the coins.

In the mid-1st century ad another group of Central Asian invaders, the [Kushāns](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Kushan), founded a great empire in northwestern India; they left a wealth of gold and copper coins with legends in the Bactrian language, written in cursive Greek letters. Their coin types—of king on obverse and deity on reverse—became the general style of northern Indian coinage for the next 1,000 years. The type was continued by the kings of Kashmir to the 10th century and adopted, with modifications, by the great Gupta emperors in the 4th century. The Guptas struck an extensive gold coinage; among the more notable Gupta coins are those that commemorate [Chandra Gupta I’s](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Chandra-Gupta-I) [horse sacrifice](https://www.britannica.com/topic/ashvamedha) or depict him as a lyrist.

In western India a dynasty of satraps of Persian origin had been ruling since the 1st century ad. Their extensive silver coinage is dated and therefore of unusual historical value. This kingdom was overthrown by the Guptas at the end of the 4th century, and they at once began to imitate this silver coinage locally. The Huns (Hephthalites), who destroyed the Gupta and other smaller states in northern India in the 6th century, left numerous coins, imitated from Sāsānian, Gupta, or Kushān prototypes. Copies of these continued to circulate in parts of northern India until the revival of various Hindu dynasties from the 10th century onward. A notable adaptation of a Hun design was the neat silver coinage of the Shahis of [Gandhara](https://www.britannica.com/place/Gandhara) of the “bull and horseman” type in the 9th and 10th centuries, extensively imitated by the Muslim conquerors of India and the contemporary minor Hindu dynasties. The other type favoured by the medieval Hindu dynasties for their gold coinage was that of a seated goddess—going back to a Gupta reverse—and an inscription with the king’s name on the other side.

The coinages of southern India form a class by themselves. In the later centuries bc and early ad, the Andhras ruled a great kingdom in central southern India; they issued coins mainly of lead but also of copper and silver with types based on Greek or local northern Indian designs.

The later medieval dynasties of southern India struck coinages mainly of gold, the type of which is usually the badge of the dynasty; the Cheras of Malabar, for example, had an elephant, the Chalukyas of the Deccan a boar, the Pandyas a fish, and the cup-shaped pieces of the Kadambas a lotus. The [Chola dynasty](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Chola-dynasty) introduced under northern influence the type of a king standing, on obverse, and, on the reverse, the king seated, which spread through southern India and was taken to Ceylon by the Chola conquest and adopted locally. The great Hindu kingdom of [Vijayanagar](https://www.britannica.com/place/Vijayanagar) (Mysore) left a large series of small gold and copper coins with types of various deities.

### Islamic

The earliest Arab invaders had reached India in the 8th century and founded a dynasty in Sind, which left numerous very small [silver](https://www.britannica.com/science/silver) coins of the Umayyad type. The [coinage](https://www.britannica.com/money/coinage) of the [Ghūrid dynasty](https://www.britannica.com/place/Ghurid-sultanate) of northwest Afghanistan and its successors from the 12th century onward is varied and extensive, mainly [gold](https://www.britannica.com/science/gold-chemical-element) and silver tangas (or rupees) of 10.76 grams. Gold was hardly issued at all in the 15th and 16th centuries, and for a time the coinage was mainly billon. [Shēr Shāh of Sūr](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Sher-Shah-of-Sur) (1540–45), of northern India, issued a large silver [currency](https://www.britannica.com/money/currency) of a type carrying the profession of the faith and names of the four caliphs, that was imitated by the [Mughal](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Mughal-dynasty) successor of the Sūİs.

The coinages of Bābur and Humāyūn, the first two of the Mughal conquerors of India, are not extensive and are of Central Asian character. With the next two emperors, Akbar and [Jahāngīr](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Jahangir), is found a series unrivaled for variety and, within limitations, beauty—the gold coins of Jahāngir are noble examples of Muslim calligraphy. In the 16th century the type that goes back to Shēr Shāh prevailed: the profession of the faith with the names of the first four caliphs and the emperor’s titles on the other side; [Aurangzeb](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Aurangzeb) replaced the [confession of faith](https://www.britannica.com/topic/confession-of-faith-theology) by the [mint](https://www.britannica.com/money/mint-metallurgy) and date, and this remained the usual type until the end of the dynasty. The emperor’s name is usually enshrined in a Persian couplet to the effect that the metal of the coins acquires added lustre from bearing the emperor’s name. Nearly 50 such verses are found on Jahāngīr’s coins. His reign is also remarkable for the series of coins bearing signs of the zodiac and for the set of portrait mohurs, one of which represents him holding a wine cup. From the beginning of the 18th century the coins become stereotyped, and the epigraphy loses its beauty. The European East India companies copied the native types from the local coinages and did not strike on European lines until the 19th century. A uniform coinage for territories under British administration was introduced in 1835. The right of native states to mint their own coinage was gradually curtailed by the British government. Since 1948, India, Pakistan, and [Sri Lanka](https://www.britannica.com/place/Sri-Lanka) have had their own coinages. Bangladesh commenced independent coinage on Jan. 1, 1972.

### Miscellaneous

Mention should also be made of the extensive Nepalese coinage in gold and silver with Sanskrit legends; the coinage of Tibet, related to that of Nepal; and the long series of octagonal gold and silver coins of Assam, struck until about 1821.

### China

Before coins were invented, cowrie shells were used as [money](https://www.britannica.com/money/money) in China. The earliest Chinese coins are small bronze hoes and knives, copies of the tools that previously had been used for barter. The knife coins (*tao*) were about six inches (15 centimetres) long and some bore inscriptions naming the issuer and giving the value. Hoe coins bore similar inscriptions. Both types circulated during the 4th and 3rd centuries bc. Round money with a hole in the centre was issued about the mid-3rd century, but it was not until 221 bc that the reforming emperor [Shih huang-ti](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Qin-Shi-Huang) (221–210/209 bc) superseded all other currencies by the issue of round coins (*pan-liang*) of half an ounce. (There were 24 grains in the Chinese ounce, and in the Han period the ounce weighed 16 grams.) These *pan-liang* coins were continued by the [Han dynasty](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Han-dynasty). The official weight of this coin was gradually reduced until it was replaced in 118 bc by the emperor [Wu-ti](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Wudi-emperor-of-Southern-Liang-dynasty) ’s five-grain (*chu*) piece, which remained the standard coin of China for the next three centuries; a break in the monotony of the regular coinage occurred in the archaistic innovations of the usurper [Wang Mang](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Wang-Mang) (ad 9–23), who issued a series of token coins based on the *tao* and on square Japanese *pu* coins and various new round coins.

After the Han period (206 bc – ad 220), the standard coin underwent many modifications. The coin was issued in iron and lead, in six-grain and four-grain weights, and in token versions. Yet the ideal of the five-grain coin of Han survived until the rise of the [T’ang dynasty](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Tang-dynasty), when the emperor Kao-tsu in 621 issued the Kai-yuan coin, which gave the coinage of all the Far East its form until the end of the 19th century—a round coin with a square hole and a four-character legend stating the function (*tong-bao,* which means “circulating treasure”) and date of the coin. The Southern [Sung dynasty](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Song-dynasty) (1127–1279) dated their coins on the reverse with regnal years, and the T’ang and Ming dynasties (618–907 and 1368–1644, respectively) put the mint name on the reverse, as did the [Ch’ing dynasty](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Qing-dynasty) (1644–1911/12), this last giving it in Manchu characters. Paper money has been in use in China since the 9th century and was current almost to the exclusion of regular coins under certain Mongol emperors, such as [Kublai Khan](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Kublai-Khan), whose paper money is described by [Marco Polo](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Marco-Polo). For more than 2,000 years the [copper](https://www.britannica.com/science/copper) [cash](https://www.britannica.com/money/cash-money) was the only official coinage of China; gold and silver were current by weight only, the latter in the form of ingots. As a result of the popularity of imported Spanish colonial and Mexican dollars, several attempts were made to institute a silver coinage based on the [dollar](https://www.britannica.com/money/dollar) in the 19th century; not until the very end of the 19th century were mints established to strike silver and copper coins of European style. Under the republic, coins were at once struck with the portraits of [Sun Yat-sen](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Sun-Yat-sen) and Pres. [Yüan Shih-k’ai](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Yuan-Shikai), and the various generals who fought for control of China issued their own coins. The currency of both the People’s Republic of China and Taiwan is the [yuan](https://www.britannica.com/money/renminbi) (dollar). The very extensive series of [talismans](https://www.britannica.com/topic/amulet), coinlike in shape but usually larger and in their legends and types reflecting popular Chinese religious thought, is noteworthy.

### Japan

The art of [coinage](https://www.britannica.com/money/coinage) was borrowed from China by Japan, whose first bronze coins were issued in ad 708. To the mid-10th century, 12 different issues were made, each of a different reign. For the next 600 years, however, no government coins were issued, and grain and cloth were used as [money](https://www.britannica.com/money/money). From the Middle Ages imported Chinese coins began to circulate along with locally minted imitations. In 1624 the [copper](https://www.britannica.com/science/copper) *kwan-ei* was first issued and remained in vast variety the usual issue for more than two centuries. The *ei-raku* and *bun-kyū sen* of the 19th century were the only other regular copper coins. Unlike China, Japan has had a [gold](https://www.britannica.com/science/gold-chemical-element) and [silver](https://www.britannica.com/science/silver) coinage since the 16th century. The gold coins are large flat pieces in the shape of rectangles with rounded corners, the largest size being *ōban* and the smaller *koban*. Other gold pieces are the small rectangular pieces of one and two *bu* issued from time to time; round gold is rare and usually of provincial mints. Silver was originally in the form of stamped bars called long silver; these were supplemented by small lumps, also stamped, called bean silver. They were later augmented by issues of silver pieces in the same shape as the small rectangular gold coins.

In 1869 a [mint](https://www.britannica.com/money/mint-metallurgy) on European lines was established in Tokyo, and gold, silver (yen or dollars), and copper were regularly issued from it until [World War II](https://www.britannica.com/event/World-War-II), when [nickel](https://www.britannica.com/science/nickel-chemical-element) and various alloys superseded the precious metals. After World War II the [yen](https://www.britannica.com/money/yen) was retained as the unit of [currency](https://www.britannica.com/money/currency). The *e sen* of Japan are not coins but amulets.

### Korea

The earliest coins found in Korea were Chinese knife coins of the 3rd century bc. The local production of coins did not begin until the 9th to 10th century ad, when copies of contemporary Chinese Kai-yuan coins were made. Coins with local inscriptions, still based on the Chinese model, were issued from the 12th century. Chinese-style coins continued to be used until Japanese and Russian influence led to the introduction of Western-style coinage in the late 19th century.

### Vietnam, Kampuchea (Cambodia), Laos

[Nam Viet](https://www.britannica.com/place/Nam-Viet) (present-day Vietnam) began by imitating Chinese coins and had a regular bronze coinage of its own on the Chinese model from the 10th to the 19th century. Silver became common in the 19th century in the form of narrow oblong bars. Presentation pieces in gold, silver, and copper were created in a variety of designs bearing, for example, auspicious inscriptions and quotations from the Chinese Classics, in addition to the king’s name. The native coinage continued until World War II but had largely been replaced by French colonial issues. After independence from France, Vietnam substantially retained the Western alphabet on its often very attractive coinage. Cambodia (Kampuchea) had its own coinage from the 15th century—curious uniface round pieces decorated with simple religious pictorial designs. Western-style coinage began to replace these from the mid-19th century. Separate coinages subsequently were in circulation in Cambodia and Laos, as they were in North and South Vietnam during the 1945–76 partition.

### Burma and Thailand

The earliest coinages of [Southeast Asia](https://www.britannica.com/place/Southeast-Asia) were issued in Burma and Thailand during the late 1st millennium bc. They were derived from Indian prototypes (examples of them have also been found in Cambodia and Vietnam). From as early as the 17th century Thailand struck gold and silver coins in the form of balls made by doubling in the ends of a short, thick bar of silver and bearing the stamp of the reigning monarch (“bullet” coins). After about 1860 it had a coinage on European lines with issues in gold, silver, tin and copper, and later nickel.

## Coins of Africa

The [Aksumite](https://www.britannica.com/place/Aksum-ancient-kingdom-Africa) kings, powerful rulers of a kingdom in northern Ethiopia from the 2nd to the 9th century ce, who were Christian from the 4th century, issued small gold coins, with a little bronze and very rare silver, from the 3rd century onward; the initially Greek inscriptions were replaced ultimately by Amharic. Indigenous [coinage](https://www.britannica.com/money/coinage) lapsed in the 10th century, the country becoming dependent on imported currencies, of which the silver [Maria Theresa](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Maria-Theresa) thalers of Austria were conspicuous from the 18th century onward. National coinage was resumed by King [Menilek II](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Menilek-II), emperor of [Ethiopia](https://www.britannica.com/place/Ethiopia) (1889–1913), with silver coins called talaris and their fractions and subsidiary copper, showing the Lion of Judah reverse—an allusion to the tradition that Menilek I had been the son of King Solomon and the [Queen of Sheba](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Queen-of-Sheba). Some gold came later, to be continued by Emperor [Haile Selassie](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Haile-Selassie-I) (1930–36), who coined also in [nickel](https://www.britannica.com/science/nickel-chemical-element) and bronze until the Italian occupation and after his restoration in 1941. A national coinage continued after he was deposed in 1974.

### North Africa

Elsewhere the 19th-century partition of Africa by colonial powers led to a great miscellany of currencies before decolonization and independence were achieved from the mid-20th century. [Egypt](https://www.britannica.com/place/Egypt), after gaining independence from the [Ottoman Empire](https://www.britannica.com/place/Ottoman-Empire) in 1914, based its [currency](https://www.britannica.com/money/currency) on the [piastre](https://www.britannica.com/topic/piastre-African-coin), with Arabic inscriptions; some gold and silver multiples were produced. Under [Fuʾād I](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Fuad-I) (1922–36) and [Farouk I](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Farouk-I) (1936–52), the royal portrait was used. The subsequent republic, with its piastres of aluminum-bronze [alloy](https://www.britannica.com/technology/alloy) accompanied by rare silver and even rarer gold, has often chosen types referring to national history (e.g., the Great Sphinx, [Ramses II](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Ramses-II-king-of-Egypt), the Aswan High Dam).

The piastre became the unit of [Libya](https://www.britannica.com/place/Libya), which, after a period as an Italian colony, briefly became a kingdom under [Idris I](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Idris-I-king-of-Libya) (1951–69), with a fine portrait coinage, before the regime of Col. [Muammar al-Qaddafi](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Muammar-al-Qaddafi). The piastre was also the unit of the French protectorate of [Tunisia](https://www.britannica.com/place/Tunisia) until 1891, when a coinage of francs and centimes was introduced. Independence from France in 1956 brought Arabic inscriptions. The piastre was also adopted in 1956 as the unit of the new republic of [Sudan](https://www.britannica.com/place/Sudan). In [Morocco](https://www.britannica.com/place/Morocco), however, which was an early 20th-century protectorate of France, the unit was the Arabic silver dirham, replaced in 1902 by the silver [rial](https://www.britannica.com/money/rial) until the introduction of the [franc](https://www.britannica.com/money/franc) in 1921.

### Sub-Saharan Africa

Farther south the various regional currencies grew out of the 19th-century European colonization. Thus, [Ghana](https://www.britannica.com/place/Ghana), before independence in 1957, had been the British colony of the Gold Coast, in which the British denominations of [shilling](https://www.britannica.com/money/shilling) and penny were traditionally used; special gold was coined to [mark](https://www.britannica.com/money/mark-German-currency) the declaration of a republic in 1960. Similar developments took place in the British colonies of [East Africa](https://www.britannica.com/place/eastern-Africa) and in the colonial territories of Northern and [Southern Rhodesia](https://www.britannica.com/place/Zimbabwe) (later independent as Zambia and Zimbabwe), Nyasaland (later Malawi), and Nigeria. The currency of [Liberia](https://www.britannica.com/place/Liberia) (founded by former American black slaves) from the mid-19th century consisted mainly of copper or [bronze](https://www.britannica.com/technology/bronze-alloy), with an elephant displacing the head of Liberty, of U.S. type.

In [South Africa](https://www.britannica.com/place/South-Africa), before the Union was established in 1910, the only coinage of note was that of the [South African Republic](https://www.britannica.com/place/South-African-Republic). During South Africa’s membership in the Commonwealth, its currency was assimilated to that of Great Britain. When South Africa left the Commonwealth in 1961, it established a new system based on the [gold](https://www.britannica.com/science/gold-chemical-element) [rand](https://www.britannica.com/money/rand-South-African-currency).

Coinage for the [French](https://www.britannica.com/place/French-Equatorial-Africa) colonies such as the [Cameroons](https://www.britannica.com/place/Cameroon), [French West Africa](https://www.britannica.com/place/French-West-Africa) and Equatorial Africa, [Madagascar](https://www.britannica.com/place/Madagascar), and French [Togoland](https://www.britannica.com/place/Togo), showed the French cockerel or the head of “Marianne” (emblem of the spirit of the French Revolution) and was in general more standardized than in the British colonies. In the principal Portuguese colonies, [Angola](https://www.britannica.com/place/Angola) and [Mozambique](https://www.britannica.com/place/Mozambique), the former used macutas (equal to 50 reis) of [copper](https://www.britannica.com/science/copper), followed by centavos and [silver](https://www.britannica.com/science/silver) escudos, whereas copper reis were current in the latter, followed by escudos or centavos. In the former [Belgian Congo](https://www.britannica.com/place/Belgian-Congo) (now the Democratic Republic of the Congo), originally established as the [Congo Free State](https://www.britannica.com/place/Congo-Free-State) by King Leopold II in 1885, currency was based on silver francs and copper centimes.

## Techniques of production

The essential advantage of using metals for currency, apart from durability, is that they can be shaped by melting and [casting](https://www.britannica.com/technology/casting-technology). Casting, therefore, has always been an integral part of the coin manufacturing process. Indeed, in some instances, it has been the only part. In early China bronze was cast into the form of the hoes and knives originally used for payment, and up to the 19th century the objects called “cash,” with their square central holes, were also cast. Similarly, the first Roman issues, aes grave (heavy bronze), were ponderous cast pieces, the heaviest actually corresponding in weight to the libra, the Roman pound. However, as soon as the state realized that it could make a profit from issuing coins by decreeing that their value in the market should be greater than the [intrinsic value](https://www.britannica.com/money/intrinsic-value) of their metal content, casting—so simple an operation—at once led to [counterfeiting](https://www.britannica.com/topic/counterfeiting). Provided the mold was made from an official coin, there was no straightforward visual way of distinguishing true from false. For this reason, casting alone seems not to have been employed for precious metal currency.

The prototype coinage of Greek Ionia on the west central coast of Anatolia in the 7th century bc consisted of pellets of [electrum](https://www.britannica.com/science/electrum) (a gold–silver alloy) made by pouring the molten metal onto the striated surface of an anvil, where, under the action of [surface tension](https://www.britannica.com/science/surface-tension), they assumed a characteristic lenslike shape before solidification. The weight of the pellets was checked and confirmed for use by stamping them with a [punch](https://www.britannica.com/technology/punch-tool) —a naillike piece of metal, probably of bronze or iron. The punch sometimes had a crudely fractured end surface (which, of course, would be unique), sometimes an engraved design (the latter produced on the punch by drilling with abrasive corundum dust, which ate away at the surface, as in the lapping process perfected over millennia for sealstones). A counterfeiter would have had great difficulty in simulating the exact form of the punch surface. Within a short time, the issuing authorities began putting their own validating punch marks on the pellets, thus producing coins as opposed to bullion. In India before the Mauryan Empire (*c.* 321–185 bc), currency consisted of small silver bars carrying as many as six marks; the boat-shaped silver emanating from [Southeast Asia](https://www.britannica.com/place/Southeast-Asia) in the 19th century was also officially confirmed in this fashion.

### Ancient minting

Most of the ancient dies that have survived are of bronze, although iron dies are thought to have been widely used also. Lower dies seem generally to have been disk-shaped so that they could sit in a recess on an anvil. In some instances the design may have been cut directly on the anvil. Engraving of the details was carried out using small steel tools (scorpers), or designs were drilled out using corundum dust. It is possible that major elements of the design were inserted by a “hub,” or master punch stamped into the die, but not all scholars accept that this method was employed in antiquity.

Blanks or planchets (i.e., the small metal disks from which coins are made) seem first to have been cast by pouring the molten [alloy](https://www.britannica.com/technology/alloy) from a crucible onto a flat surface, where they cooled into the characteristic lens shape. Later the metal was poured into [molds](https://www.britannica.com/technology/mold-technology), which sometimes consisted of two parts so that the metal was completely enclosed; traces of the “flash,” or joining line, can still be seen on surviving coins. At Alexandria in the Ptolemaic period (323–30 bc), open molds were common; in these a sequence of disk-shaped impressions in the mold were connected by channels, and a number of blanks were thus obtained at one pouring. The upper surface of the blank, where slag and oxide accumulated, had to be “turned” off, or drilled out, presumably by a tool like a carpenter’s bit, and the centre punch [mark](https://www.britannica.com/money/mark-German-currency) to accommodate the tool point is characteristic of Ptolemaic, Seleucid, and Greek imperial coins. Contemporary issues in India were often square in outline and were cut by chisel from metal sheets. Many Greek and [Roman](https://www.britannica.com/place/ancient-Rome) [silver](https://www.britannica.com/science/silver) coins were plated; an envelope of silver sheet was soldered on a [copper](https://www.britannica.com/science/copper) core, and it is by no means certain that all such specimens were the work of counterfeiters, since solid silver and plated coins sometimes appear to have been struck from the same dies. In the later Roman Empire (3rd century ad) silver issues were heavily debased with copper; prior to striking, the blanks were immersed in an acid bath that leached out the surface copper to expose more silver, giving a much more acceptable appearance to the coins when they were first issued.

Striking—the impression of the die designs on the blanks—was startlingly simple. The lower die, set in the anvil, was covered by the blank; the upper die, which was positioned above, was then given one or more hammer blows. A two-pound hammer, wielded by one hand, could easily give a force at the die face of seven tons. To get the high relief typical of Greek issues, two or three blows were necessary, and often there is evidence of double-striking on the coins. However, by preheating the blank, as practiced in Athens in the 5th century bc, less force was required and die life was extended. Analysis of the documentary evidence implies that one obverse (lower) die could produce upward of 20,000 coins, while 10,000 coins have been struck from a simulated bronze die without significant deterioration of the working surface. Receiving the hammer blows more directly, the reverse (upper) dies enjoyed about half the life of the obverse. Production rates varied. In small mints, operated by one man, a rate of 100 coins per hour has been shown to have been feasible. At important centres such as Rome or Antioch teams of four probably operated. An eyewitness account of a Persian [mint](https://www.britannica.com/money/mint-metallurgy) in the 1870s describes how, with a hammerer, a die holder, a blank placer, and a coin remover, one piece could be struck about every two seconds.

### Medieval minting

Alterations in the flan (the coin disk, a term deriving from the French *flatir,* “to beat flat”) led to corresponding changes in the manufacture of dies. In about ad 220 the [Sāsānian dynasty](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Sasanian-dynasty) of Iran introduced the concept of thin flan coins, issues that were struck in relief on both sides. In order not to produce intolerable stresses in the dies, since the thinner the material the more force necessary to make it flow into the recesses of the die’s design, the depth of relief on such coins was of necessity much shallower than with earlier [currency](https://www.britannica.com/money/currency). Such techniques spread by way of Byzantium to northern Europe, where the emperor Charlemagne struck thin flan deniers (small silver coins), or pennies, which became characteristic of both his own and neighbouring kingdoms.

The Franks and Saxons inherited an art that was formalistic rather than realistic, and this permitted their coin designs to be made up from a small number of standard elements that were reproducible using punches. It has been shown, for example, that the complete dies for all of the coin types of Edward the Confessor of England could be obtained from seven punches, giving individual wedges, crescents, pellets, and bars, each of which was independently struck to make up a legend and design. Consequently, a single workshop could supply the 70 or so contemporary English mints in a relatively short time. An experimental pair of dies took less than an hour to fabricate. Of course, many European dies were produced by a combination of punching and engraving, while engraving alone was typical of early Islamic and contemporary Oriental dies. With the advent of larger denominations, such as the gros tournois (based on the weight standard of Tours, in France) in the 13th century, more florid designs came to be preferred, but the elements of the royal [crown](https://www.britannica.com/money/crown-monetary-unit), for example, or the letters of the legend were still punched into the dies. To judge from surviving specimens, both upper and lower dies (trussells and piles) were by then produced from [wrought iron](https://www.britannica.com/technology/wrought-iron). While the upper die retained the cylindrical shape of antiquity, the lower die was tanged (having protrusions added) so that it could be wedged into a wooden block.

The thin silver sheet required for the new coins needed to be beaten out from its cast state, and this in turn necessitated annealing (strengthening by slow cooling) to prevent cracking. By the 10th century, squares of sheet, somewhat larger than the eventual penny, were being struck between square dies and then separated by a circular cutter. A few imitative coins on square flans are known from Scandinavia, while die identical coins have exactly matching edge irregularities, proving use of the same cutter. With the introduction of the gros tournois, the blanks were cut roughly circular with shears, then gripped by special tongs in rouleaux (columnar rolls) of a dozen or more, and finally hammered into circularity on a flat anvil. Alternatively, the silver was cast into thin rods of rectangular section; pieces of the correct length (and hence weight) were next cut from the rod by chisel and then, with several annealings, were beaten to the appropriate thickness, before being rounded and struck by a die. Blanching (cleaning) of the blanks by an acid dip was necessary before striking to produce an acceptable surface if oxidation had occurred during annealing.

Striking was carried out in much the same way as during antiquity, although contemporary illustrations indicate that only one operator, not a team, was employed. Twelfth-century Byzantine coins were often cup shaped. A full impression of the curved dies could not easily be obtained by one blow; hence there evolved a method of striking one half of the coin with a slightly inclined upper die, which was then rocked over to the other side for a second blow. [Bracteates](https://www.britannica.com/topic/bracteate-coin), issues of foil thickness, were common in 12th-century Germany. To make these, a single die was used to strike a column of several blanks resting on a piece of leather, so that the reverse of each was the incuse (hollowed impression) of the obverse. Die life in general was higher than during antiquity, and documentary evidence for 13th-century English pence indicates perhaps 30,000 coins per obverse. There is no evidence for production rates.

### Early modern minting

The increase of mining activity in central Europe during the 15th century gave a great impetus to the development of modern minting processes. The dies themselves were still made by punches, but these, in turn, had become much more sophisticated, often embodying a complete portrait of the monarch. Their general shape depended on the striking process employed, but the material used was a steel that could be hardened by [carburizing](https://www.britannica.com/technology/carburizing) (putting iron in a bed of carbon in a sealed air-tight box, and thence into a furnace, where the carbon diffused into the outer layers) after the designs had been punched in, or sunk.

The metal for the coins was cast as ingots, a typical size being 1 / 2 × 1 × 20 inches. These were then passed between steel rollers, powered by a water mill or horse gin (a mechanism that translated horsepower into rotational energy), to reduce the thickness. Several passes and annealings were necessary to obtain the correct thickness. The blanks, particularly for the larger crown-sized coins being introduced, continued to be roughly cut with shears from the rolled fillet (metal strip), so that, as previously, they could easily be adjusted for weight before being rounded in rouleaux. In some cases, however, they were punched by a machine from the fillet to a fixed diameter, so that the thickness was critical for controlling weight. To protect against clipping, during the next century a security edge was sometimes rolled onto the blank; this might consist of an inscription or a serrated or milled edge.

Hand-operated [screw presses](https://www.britannica.com/technology/screw-press) were developed for stamping the designs on the blanks; although the blanks originally were centred on the lower die by eye, it soon became clear that a locating collar would prevent off-centre striking. Such a method was used by [Benvenuto Cellini](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Benvenuto-Cellini-Italian-artist), who struck coins for Italian princes in the first half of the 16th century, and it was then introduced first to Paris and then to London in the 1550s.

At the same time the [roller press](https://www.britannica.com/technology/roller-press) was under development in Germany. Initially, the die designs were engraved or punched into the curved surfaces of two rollers that were geared together so that the whole fillet (rather than single blanks) could be fed between them and emerge impressed. This method was advantageous in requiring less power: only part of the blank was being deformed at any one time, and so, as compared with the screw press, the stresses on the machine were reduced. Because of imperfections, the fillet and the finished coins as punched out were markedly curved, and the coins required flattening (planishing) by light tapping with a smooth-faced hammer.

The difficulty of taking out the complete rollers from such a press led to an ingenious variation—the *Taschenwerke*. In this machine the rollers were replaced by rectangular shafts pierced in the middle to take a pair of dies with tapered extensions (tangs). The axis of the upper shaft could be raised or lowered a short distance to accommodate variations in the dies or differing coin thicknesses. Such machines continued to be used in Germany into the 18th century.

The rocker press represents another variation. The bottom roller (actually a quadrant insert, as in the *Taschenwerke*) remained stationary; the axis of the upper roller rotated about this lower axis as a small circle around a larger, so that the upper die face rolled over a stationary fillet that had been positioned over the lower die. One such mechanism, now in the [British Museum](https://www.britannica.com/topic/British-Museum), produced minor [copper](https://www.britannica.com/science/copper) coins in Spain soon after 1600.

The prolific Jean Warin, one of the great engravers, finally established the use of the fly press, a variation on the screw press in which the helix angle of the screw was much increased. The rotational arms ended in heavy weights that were swung with great velocity by two operators (working for only 20 minutes in each hour), and the elasticity of the system caused a rebound of the arm to its original position after the coin had been struck. Again, with a team of moneyers, a rate of production of a coin every second or so could be achieved. In some Russian mints of about 1800 a guided dropping weight functioned in much the same way, regaining its original position partly by rebounding and partly by operators pulling on return ropes running over pulleys.

### Contemporary mints

In the 1770s the [steam engines](https://www.britannica.com/technology/steam-engine) of [Matthew Boulton](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Matthew-Boulton) and the Scottish inventor [James Watt](https://www.britannica.com/biography/James-Watt) made available new sources of power that were soon adapted to the coining process. Initially used to strike commercial tokens, these methods were eventually taken up by the Royal Mint in London. Experiments produced new steels that could cope with the much higher stresses involved, while a French invention, the [pantograph](https://www.britannica.com/art/pantograph), or reducing machine, permitted the manufacture of a standardized design for every denomination, all being reproduced identically but to differing scales.

In modern minting, the sequence of die manufacture is as follows. A plaster model of the proposed design, about one foot (0.3 metre) in diameter, is received from the artist and a mold is made; from this is obtained an electrotype copy in [nickel](https://www.britannica.com/science/nickel-chemical-element) and copper. Mounted in the reducing machine, the copy permits the cutting of the design to the appropriate coin size in a block of steel, the master punch, which has features in relief, as on the eventual coin. The master is then used to punch-in, or sink, a matrix; this raises a working punch, which is used to sink a working die. Imperfections at any stage are removed by hand tooling and, for best results, the surface of the working die is highly polished before it is sunk.

The production of blanks (called planchets in the [United States](https://www.britannica.com/place/United-States)) is highly automated. At the U.S. Mint in Philadelphia, for example, the incoming metal is assayed to ensure that it is of the correct specification. After being sheared into small pieces, the metal, together with the waste clippings (scissel) from previous blanking operations, is conveyed to a computer-controlled weighing section, where a charging bucket is filled with the correct proportions of each constituent of the required alloy; the metal then goes into a 15,000-pound-capacity electric induction melting furnace. During the melting, deoxidation additives are introduced, and the furnace is then tilted to pour the metal into a water-cooled, semicontinuous casting machine mold with a movable bottom. The resulting vertical [ingot](https://www.britannica.com/technology/ingot), with dimensions of 16 inches by 6 inches by 18 feet and a weight of 6,600 pounds, is set on a roller conveyer in a horizontal position preparatory to being cut by a rotary saw into two equal lengths. The bars are next raised in temperature in a high-frequency [induction coil](https://www.britannica.com/technology/induction-coil) so that they can be hot-rolled. After nine passes the thickness of the bars is reduced to less than one-half inch, and the length is extended to approximately 115 feet. Quenching with water is followed by skim milling in order to remove the oxide layer on the top and the bottom surfaces. The coils of strip metal are next cold-rolled, reducing the thickness to about one-tenth of an inch. The ends of the individual coils are then trimmed and welded together, giving a large coil weighing some 4 1 / 2 tons. Finally, the coil is rolled under tension in a finishing mill, where the thickness is controlled by sensors.

The blanking presses are typically high speed, punching out from the coils as many as 21 planchets per stroke at 100 or more strokes per minute, the scissel being returned to the melting pot. For coins of small denomination the planchets are then fed into an annealing furnace, quenched with water, cleaned with acid, washed, and dried. The subsequent operation is edge-up setting, the partial formation of a protective rim by forcing the blank into too small a hole. The planchets then proceed to the coining presses, many of which are adapted to cope with four coins at one blow. The spread of the metal under the force of the die is confined by a collar, and the radial recovery of the metal as the load is removed prevents its adherence to the collar, as the latter is retracted below die level. The struck coins are taken to a checking point, after which they are counted and bagged, ready for distribution. Die life is upwards of 200,000 coins.

The procedures at the [United Kingdom](https://www.britannica.com/place/United-Kingdom) ’s Royal Mint, at Llantrisant, Wales, are analogous. There, however, the ingots are cast continuously, not in discrete lengths, and they are subsequently sawed for the rolling operations. The edge-up setting is sometimes combined with the impression of a channeled security edge of the type found on Indian issues. To assist metal flow during striking, the washing and lubricating of the blanks are combined. The production of seven-sided coins (20- and 50-pence denominations) from circular blanks indicates the extent of the flow of the blank metal within the collar; the striking presses are capable of 600 strokes per minute. The counting and bagging operation is performed by robots. An experiment in obtaining the correct weight of [gold](https://www.britannica.com/science/gold-chemical-element) issues, where the “remedy,” or tolerance (permitted range of variation in the standard), is very limited, showed that when the blanks were punched from fillets that were one-third inch thick and then pressed out to the normal thickness of one-tenth of an inch, the same error in initial thickness had less eventual effect on the weight of a one-third-inch blank than on a one-tenth-inch blank. In this experiment the same solution to obtaining correct weight was applied as in the medieval period, when the use of easily measurable lengths of thin [silver](https://www.britannica.com/science/silver) rods gave the correct weight per penny.

## Functions of money

The basic function of money is to enable buying to be separated from selling, thus permitting trade to take place without the so-called double coincidence of [barter](https://www.britannica.com/money/barter-trade). In principle, [credit](https://www.britannica.com/money/credit) could perform this function, but, before extending credit, the seller would want to know about the prospects of repayment. That requires much more information about the buyer and imposes costs of information and verification that the use of money avoids.

If a person has something to sell and wants something else in return, the use of money avoids the need to search for someone able and willing to make the desired exchange of items. The person can sell the surplus item for general purchasing power—that is, “money”—to anyone who wants to buy it and then use the proceeds to buy the desired item from anyone who wants to sell it.

The importance of this function of money is dramatically illustrated by the experience of [Germany](https://www.britannica.com/place/Germany) just after World War II, when paper money was rendered largely useless because of [price controls](https://www.britannica.com/money/incomes-policy) that were enforced effectively by the American, French, and British armies of occupation. Money rapidly lost its value. People were unwilling to exchange real goods for Germany’s depreciating currency. They resorted to barter or to other inefficient money substitutes (such as cigarettes). Price controls reduced incentives to produce. The country’s economic output fell by half. Later the German “economic miracle” that took root just after 1948 reflected, in part, a currency reform instituted by the occupation authorities that replaced depreciating money with money of stable value. At the same time, the reform eliminated all price controls, thereby permitting a money economy to replace a barter economy.

These examples have shown the “medium of exchange” function of money. Separation of the act of sale from the act of purchase requires the existence of something that will be generally accepted in [payment](https://www.britannica.com/money/payment). But there must also be something that can serve as a temporary store of purchasing power, in which the seller holds the proceeds in the interim between the sale and the subsequent purchase or from which the buyer can extract the general purchasing power with which to pay for what is bought. This is called the “ [asset](https://www.britannica.com/money/asset) ” function of money.

## Varieties of money

Anything can serve as money that habit or social convention and successful experience endow with the quality of general acceptability, and a variety of items have so served—from the [wampum](https://www.britannica.com/money/wampum) (beads made from shells) of American Indians, to [cowries](https://www.britannica.com/animal/cowrie) (brightly coloured shells) in India, to whales’ teeth among the Fijians, to tobacco among early colonists in [North America](https://www.britannica.com/place/North-America), to large stone disks on the Pacific island of [Yap](https://www.britannica.com/place/Yap-Islands), to cigarettes in post-World War II Germany and in prisons the world over. In fact, the wide use of cattle as money in [primitive](https://www.britannica.com/topic/primitive-culture) times survives in the word *pecuniary*, which comes from the Latin *pecus*, meaning cattle. The development of money has been marked by repeated innovations in the objects used as money.
