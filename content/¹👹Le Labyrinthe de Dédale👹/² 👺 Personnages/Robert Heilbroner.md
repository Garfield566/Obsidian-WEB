**Robert L. Heilbroner** (March 24, 1919 – January 4, 2005) was an American [economist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economist "Economist") and [historian of economic thought](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_economic_thought "History of economic thought"). The author of some two dozen books, Heilbroner was best known for *The Worldly Philosophers: The Lives, Times and Ideas of the Great Economic Thinkers* (1953), a survey of the lives and contributions of famous economists, notably [Adam Smith](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_Smith "Adam Smith"), [Karl Marx](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl_Marx "Karl Marx"), and [John Maynard Keynes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Maynard_Keynes "John Maynard Keynes").

Heilbroner was born in 1919, in [New York City](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City "New York City"), to a wealthy [German Jewish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_Jews_in_Germany "History of the Jews in Germany") family. His father, Louis Heilbroner, was a businessman who founded the men's clothing retailer [Weber & Heilbroner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weber_%26_Heilbroner "Weber & Heilbroner").<sup id="cite_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-2"><span class="cite-bracket">[</span>2<span class="cite-bracket">]</span></a></sup> Robert graduated from [Harvard University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvard_University "Harvard University") in 1940 with a *[summa cum laude](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summa_cum_laude "Summa cum laude")* degree in philosophy, government and economics. During [World War II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II "World War II"), he served in the [United States Army](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Army "United States Army") and worked at the Office of Price Control under [John Kenneth Galbraith](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Kenneth_Galbraith "John Kenneth Galbraith"), the highly celebrated and controversial [Institutionalist economist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institutional_economics "Institutional economics").

## Career

After World War II, Heilbroner worked briefly as a banker and entered into academia in the 1950s as a research fellow at the [New School for Social Research](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_School_for_Social_Research "New School for Social Research") in New York. During this period, he was highly influenced by the German economist [Adolph Lowe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adolph_Lowe "Adolph Lowe"), who was a foremost representative of the German Historical School. In 1963, Heilbroner earned a [Ph.D.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_of_Philosophy "Doctor of Philosophy") in Economics from the [New School for Social Research](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_School_for_Social_Research "New School for Social Research"), where he was subsequently appointed [Norman Thomas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norman_Thomas "Norman Thomas") Professor of Economics in 1971, and where he remained for more than twenty years. He mainly taught History of Economic Thought courses at the New School.

Although a highly unconventional economist, who regarded himself as more of a social theorist and "worldly philosopher" (philosopher pre-occupied with "worldly" affairs, such as economic structures), and who tended to integrate the disciplines of history, economics and philosophy, Heilbroner was nevertheless recognized by his peers as a prominent economist. He was elected vice president of the [American Economic Association](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Economic_Association "American Economic Association") in 1972.

He also came up with a way of [classifying economies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparative_economic_systems "Comparative economic systems"), as either Traditional (primarily agriculturally based, perhaps [subsistence economy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subsistence_economy "Subsistence economy")), Command (centrally [planned economy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planned_economy "Planned economy"), often involving the state), [Market](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_economy "Market economy") ([capitalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capitalism "Capitalism")), or [Mixed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mixed_economy "Mixed economy").

Though an outspoken [socialist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socialism "Socialism") for nearly his entire career, Heilbroner famously wrote in a 1989 *[New Yorker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_Yorker "The New Yorker")* article prior to the collapse of the [Soviet Union](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union "Soviet Union"):

Less than 75 years after it officially began, the contest between capitalism and socialism is over: capitalism has won... Capitalism organizes the material affairs of humankind more satisfactorily than socialism.<sup id="cite_ref-reason.com_3-0" class="reference"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.com-3"><span class="cite-bracket">[</span>3<span class="cite-bracket">]</span></a></sup>

He further wrote in *[Dissent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dissent_\(American_magazine\) "Dissent (American magazine)")* in 1992 that "capitalism has been as unmistakable a success as socialism has been a failure"<sup id="cite_ref-reason.com_3-1" class="reference"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.com-3"><span class="cite-bracket">[</span>3<span class="cite-bracket">]</span></a></sup> and complimented [Milton Friedman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milton_Friedman "Milton Friedman"), [Friedrich Hayek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friedrich_Hayek "Friedrich Hayek"), and [Ludwig von Mises](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ludwig_von_Mises "Ludwig von Mises") on their insistence of the free market's superiority.<sup id="cite_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-4"><span class="cite-bracket">[</span>4<span class="cite-bracket">]</span></a></sup> He emphasized that "democratic liberties have not yet appeared, except fleetingly, in any nation that has declared itself to be fundamentally anticapitalist."<sup id="cite_ref-reason.com_3-2" class="reference"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.com-3"><span class="cite-bracket">[</span>3<span class="cite-bracket">]</span></a></sup> However, Heilbroner's preferred capitalist model was the highly redistributionist [welfare states](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Welfare_state "Welfare state") of [Scandinavia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scandinavia "Scandinavia"); he stated that his model society was "a slightly idealized [Sweden](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweden "Sweden")."<sup id="cite_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/#cite_note-5"><span class="cite-bracket">[</span>5<span class="cite-bracket">]</span></a></sup>

## *The Worldly Philosophers*

Published in 1953, *The Worldly Philosophers: The Lives, Times and Ideas of the Great Economic Thinkers* (1953) has sold nearly four million copies, making it the second-best-selling economics text of all time (the first being [Paul Samuelson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Samuelson "Paul Samuelson")'s *[Economics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economics_\(textbook\) "Economics (textbook)")*, a highly popular university textbook).<sup id="cite_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/"><span class="cite-bracket">[</span>7<span class="cite-bracket">]</span></a></sup> The seventh edition of the book, published in 1999, included a new final chapter entitled "The End of Worldly Philosophy?", which included both a grim view on the existent state of economics as well as a hopeful vision for a "reborn worldly philosophy" that incorporated [social](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social "Social") aspects of [capitalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capitalism "Capitalism").
